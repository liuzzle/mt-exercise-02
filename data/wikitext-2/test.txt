= = <unk> = = = = = Film = = = = = = Television = = = = = = Theatre = = = = Du Fu = Du Fu ( <unk> – <unk> : Tu Fu ; Chinese : &lt; unk &gt; ; &lt; unk &gt; – 770 ) was a prominent Chinese poet of the <unk> dynasty .
<unk> with Li &lt; unk &gt; ( Li <unk> ) , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets .
His greatest <unk> was to serve his country as a successful civil <unk> , but he proved unable to make the necessary <unk> .
His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An &lt; unk &gt; Rebellion of &lt; unk &gt; , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest .
Although initially he was little @ - @ known to other writers , his works came to be <unk> influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture .
Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the <unk> .
He has been called the &quot; <unk> @ - @ <unk> &quot; and the &quot; <unk> @ - @ <unk> &quot; by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as &quot; the Chinese <unk> , <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> or &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
= = Life = = <unk> Chinese literary criticism <unk> the life of the author when <unk> a work , a practice which Burton Watson <unk> to &quot; the close links that traditional Chinese thought <unk> between art and <unk> &quot; .
Since many of Du Fu &apos; s poems feature <unk> and history , this practice is particularly important .
Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William &lt; unk &gt; , is that Chinese poems are typically &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; context that might be <unk> , but which an <unk> contemporary could be assumed to know .
For modern Western readers , &quot; The less <unk> we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more <unk> we are to <unk> it <unk> , and the result will be that we either &lt; unk &gt; the poem or <unk> to understand it <unk> &quot; .
Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet &apos; s work required <unk> of his whole life , rather than the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; &lt; unk &gt; used for more limited poets .
= = = Early years = = = Most of what is known of Du Fu &apos; s life comes from his poems .
His <unk> <unk> was Du &lt; unk &gt; , a noted <unk> and poet during the reign of <unk> <unk> .
Du Fu was born in &lt; unk &gt; ; the exact <unk> is unknown , except that it was near <unk> , <unk> province ( <unk> county is a favourite candidate ) .
In later life , he considered himself to <unk> to the capital city of Chang &apos; an , ancestral <unk> of the Du family .
Du Fu &apos; s mother died shortly after he was born , and he was partially raised by his <unk> .
He had an <unk> brother , who died young .
He also had three half brothers and one half sister , to whom he frequently refers in his poems , although he never mentions his <unk> .
The son of a minor <unk> @ - @ official , his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil <unk> : study and &lt; unk &gt; of the Confucian <unk> of philosophy , history and poetry .
He later claimed to have produced &lt; unk &gt; poems by his early <unk> , but these have been lost .
In the early &lt; unk &gt; , he travelled in the &lt; unk &gt; / <unk> area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry <unk> , is thought to date from the end of this period , around <unk> .
In that year , he took the civil service <unk> , likely in Chang &apos; an .
He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics .
&lt; unk &gt; concludes that he probably failed because his <unk> style at the time was too dense and <unk> , while Chou suggests his failure to &lt; unk &gt; connections in the capital may have been to blame .
After this failure , he went back to <unk> , this time around <unk> and <unk> .
His father died around <unk> .
Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father &apos; s rank , but he is thought to have given up the <unk> in favour of one of his half brothers .
He spent the next four years living in the <unk> area , <unk> his duties in domestic affairs .
In the autumn of &lt; unk &gt; , he met Li &lt; unk &gt; ( Li <unk> ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship .
David Young describes this as &quot; the most significant <unk> element in Du Fu &apos; s <unk> development &quot; because it gave him a living example of the <unk> poet @ - @ <unk> life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service <unk> .
The relationship was somewhat one @ - @ <unk> , however .
Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li &lt; unk &gt; was already a poetic star .
We have twelve poems to or about Li &lt; unk &gt; from the younger poet , but only one in the other direction .
They met again only once , in &lt; unk &gt; .
In <unk> , he moved to the capital in an attempt to <unk> his official career .
He took the civil service <unk> a second time during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime <unk> ( apparently in order to prevent the <unk> of possible rivals ) .
He never again attempted the <unk> , instead &lt; unk &gt; the emperor directly in &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> and probably again in &lt; unk &gt; .
He married around &lt; unk &gt; , and by &lt; unk &gt; the couple had had five children — three sons and two <unk> — but one of the sons died in <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; .
From <unk> he began to have <unk> problems ( probably <unk> ) , the first of a series of &lt; unk &gt; which &lt; unk &gt; him for the rest of his life .
It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the <unk> of a <unk> brought about by massive floods in the region .
In &lt; unk &gt; , he received an appointment as &lt; unk &gt; of the <unk> <unk> &apos; s office of the Crown Prince &apos; s Palace .
Although this was a minor post , in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career .
Even before he had begun work , however , the position was swept away by events .
= = = War = = = The An &lt; unk &gt; Rebellion began in December &lt; unk &gt; , and was not completely <unk> for almost eight years .
It caused <unk> <unk> to Chinese society : the census of <unk> recorded 52 @ .
@ 9 million people , but ten years later , the census <unk> just 16 @ .
@ 9 million , the remainder having been displaced or killed .
During this time , Du Fu led a largely <unk> life &lt; unk &gt; by wars , associated &lt; unk &gt; and imperial &lt; unk &gt; .
This period of &lt; unk &gt; was the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even <unk> Chou has written that , &quot; What he saw around him — the lives of his family , neighbors , and <unk> – what he heard , and what he hoped for or <unk> from the progress of various campaigns — these became the <unk> themes of his poetry &quot; .
Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child , he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of <unk> upon his own &lt; unk &gt; .
Du Fu wrote : &lt; unk &gt; on what I have lived through , if even I know such suffering , the common man must <unk> be &lt; unk &gt; by the winds .
In &lt; unk &gt; , Emperor &lt; unk &gt; was forced to <unk> the capital and &lt; unk &gt; .
Du Fu , who had been away from the city , took his family to a place of <unk> and attempted to join the court of the new emperor ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang &apos; an .
In the autumn , his youngest son , Du &lt; unk &gt; ( Baby <unk> ) , was born .
Around this time Du Fu is thought to have <unk> <unk> .
He escaped from Chang &apos; an the following year , and was appointed &lt; unk &gt; when he <unk> the court in May &lt; unk &gt; .
This post gave access to the emperor but was largely <unk> .
Du Fu &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; <unk> him to try to make use of it : he caused trouble for himself by <unk> the <unk> of his friend and <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> charge .
He was arrested but was &lt; unk &gt; in June .
He was granted leave to visit his family in September , but he soon <unk> the court and on December 8 , &lt; unk &gt; , he returned to Chang &apos; an with the emperor following its <unk> by government forces .
However , his advice continued to be &lt; unk &gt; , and in the summer of &lt; unk &gt; he was <unk> to a post as Commissioner of Education in &lt; unk &gt; .
The position was not to his <unk> : in one poem , he wrote : I <unk> about to scream &lt; unk &gt; in the office / <unk> when they bring more <unk> to <unk> higher on my <unk> .
He moved on in the summer of &lt; unk &gt; ; this has traditionally been <unk> to <unk> , but &lt; unk &gt; believes that <unk> is a more likely reason .
He next spent around six weeks in &lt; unk &gt; ( now &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> province ) , where he wrote more than sixty poems .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; = = = In December &lt; unk &gt; , he briefly stayed in &lt; unk &gt; ( modern <unk> ) .
He departed on December 24 for &lt; unk &gt; ( <unk> province ) , where he was hosted by local &lt; unk &gt; and fellow poet &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Du subsequently based himself in <unk> for most of the next five years .
By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble , and sent poems &lt; unk &gt; help to various <unk> .
He was <unk> by <unk> <unk> , a friend and former <unk> who was appointed governor general at &lt; unk &gt; .
Despite his financial problems , this was one of the &lt; unk &gt; and most peaceful periods of his life .
Many of Du &apos; s poems from this period are peaceful <unk> of his life at &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
In <unk> , he left the city to escape a rebellion , but he returned in summer &lt; unk &gt; when he was appointed an advisor to <unk> , who was involved in campaigns against the &lt; unk &gt; Empire .
= = = <unk> years = = = <unk> , the region of his <unk> , was recovered by government forces in the winter of <unk> , and in the spring of &lt; unk &gt; Du Fu and his family sailed down the <unk> , apparently with the intention of making their way there .
They <unk> slowly , held up by his ill @ - @ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; and general old age in addition to his previous &lt; unk &gt; ) .
They stayed in &lt; unk &gt; ( in what is now &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) at the entrance to the Three &lt; unk &gt; for almost two years from late spring &lt; unk &gt; .
This period was Du Fu &apos; s last great poetic <unk> , and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense , late style .
In autumn &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; became governor of the region : he supported Du Fu <unk> and employed him as his <unk> secretary .
In March &lt; unk &gt; , he began his journey again and got as far as &lt; unk &gt; province , where he died in &lt; unk &gt; ( now &lt; unk &gt; ) in November or December 770 , in his &lt; unk &gt; year .
He was survived by his wife and two sons , who remained in the area for some years at least .
His last known <unk> is a grandson who requested a grave <unk> for the poet from <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; his life by <unk> that , &quot; He appeared to be a &lt; unk &gt; son , an <unk> father , a <unk> brother , a <unk> husband , a loyal friend , a &lt; unk &gt; official , and a <unk> subject . &quot;
Below is an example of one of Du Fu &apos; s later works , To My &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ( Chinese : &lt; unk &gt; ) .
Like many other poems in the <unk> it featured the theme of a long <unk> between friends , which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces : = = Works = = <unk> of Du Fu &apos; s works has focused on his strong sense of history , his moral engagement , and his technical <unk> .
= = = History = = = Since the <unk> dynasty , critics have called Du Fu the &quot; poet historian &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) .
The most directly historical of his poems are those <unk> on military tactics or the <unk> and <unk> of the government , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor .
&lt; unk &gt; , he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself , and on the ordinary people of China .
As Watson notes , this is information &quot; of a kind <unk> found in the officially <unk> histories of the era &quot; .
Du Fu &apos; s political comments are based on <unk> rather than <unk> : his &lt; unk &gt; have been &lt; unk &gt; as , &quot; Let us all be less <unk> , let us all do what we are supposed to do &quot; .
Since his views were impossible to <unk> with , his &lt; unk &gt; expressed &lt; unk &gt; enabled his <unk> as the central figure of Chinese poetic history .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; engagement = = = A second favourite <unk> of Chinese critics is that of &quot; poet sage &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) , a <unk> to the <unk> sage , &lt; unk &gt; .
One of the earliest surviving works , The <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; ( from around <unk> ) , gives voice to the &lt; unk &gt; of a &lt; unk &gt; soldier in the imperial army and a clear @ - @ <unk> <unk> of suffering .
These concerns are continuously <unk> in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life .
Although Du Fu &apos; s frequent references to his own difficulties can give the <unk> of an all @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> argues that his &quot; famous <unk> in fact includes himself , viewed quite &lt; unk &gt; and almost as an &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
He therefore &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; to the wider picture by <unk> it to &quot; his own slightly <unk> <unk> &quot; .
Du Fu &apos; s <unk> , for himself and for others , was part of his general <unk> of the scope of poetry : he <unk> many works to <unk> which had previously been considered <unk> for poetic treatment .
<unk> <unk> wrote that for Du Fu , &quot; everything in this world is poetry &quot; , Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life , <unk> , paintings , animals , and other poems .
= = = <unk> <unk> = = = Du Fu &apos; s work is notable above all for its range .
Chinese critics traditionally used the term &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; &quot; complete &lt; unk &gt; &quot; ) , a reference to &lt; unk &gt; &apos; description of &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; was the first to note the <unk> of Du Fu &apos; s <unk> , writing in &lt; unk &gt; that his predecessor , &quot; <unk> in his work <unk> which previous men had displayed only <unk> &quot; .
He <unk> all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he &quot; either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples &quot; .
Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of <unk> , from the direct and &lt; unk &gt; to the &lt; unk &gt; and self @ - @ <unk> literary .
This variety is &lt; unk &gt; even within individual works : Owen <unk> the , &quot; rapid stylistic and <unk> <unk> &quot; in poems which <unk> the poet to represent different &lt; unk &gt; of a situation , while Chou uses the term &quot; <unk> &quot; as the major <unk> <unk> in her work .
Du Fu is noted for having written more on &lt; unk &gt; and painting than any other writer of his time .
He wrote <unk> poems on painting alone , more than any other <unk> poet .
Du Fu &apos; s <unk> negative commentary on the <unk> horse paintings of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; a controversy that has persisted to the present day .
The <unk> of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ( &quot; &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ like &quot; according to Watson ) : his earliest works are in a relatively <unk> , <unk> style , but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion .
Owen comments on the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; of the &lt; unk &gt; poems , which <unk> the desert landscape ; the works from his &lt; unk &gt; period are &quot; light , often <unk> observed &quot; ; while the poems from the late &lt; unk &gt; period have a &quot; density and power of vision &quot; .
Although he wrote in all poetic forms , Du Fu is best known for his &lt; unk &gt; , a type of poem with <unk> constraints on form and content , for example : About two <unk> of Du Fu &apos; s <unk> <unk> works are in this form , and he is generally considered to be its leading <unk> .
His best &lt; unk &gt; use the &lt; unk &gt; required by the form to add <unk> content rather than as <unk> technical <unk> .
<unk> comments that , &quot; it is <unk> that Tu Fu is able to use so <unk> <unk> a form in so natural a manner &quot; .
= = <unk> = = According to the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , Du Fu &apos; s writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time , and it states &quot; his dense , <unk> language makes use of all the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of a <unk> and of all the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of the individual word , qualities that no <unk> can ever reveal . &quot;
In his <unk> and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not greatly appreciated .
In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal <unk> , some of which are still &quot; considered extremely <unk> and <unk> by Chinese critics . &quot;
There are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of <unk> , but not as a &lt; unk &gt; of poetic or moral <unk> .
Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry .
However , as &lt; unk &gt; notes , he &quot; is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time &quot; , and his works began to increase in popularity in the <unk> century .
Early positive comments came from &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , who praised the moral <unk> of some of Du Fu &apos; s works ( although he found these in only a small <unk> of the poems ) , and from <unk> <unk> , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li &lt; unk &gt; on <unk> grounds from attacks made against them .
Both these writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic work .
By the beginning of the 10th century , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; constructed the first replica of his &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in <unk> .
It was in the 11th century , during the Northern <unk> era that Du Fu &apos; s reputation reached its peak .
In this period a <unk> re @ - @ <unk> of earlier poets took place , in which <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Li &lt; unk &gt; and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; and Confucian <unk> of Chinese culture .
At the same time , the development of <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> that Du Fu , as its poetic &lt; unk &gt; , occupied the <unk> position .
<unk> <unk> <unk> expressed this <unk> when he wrote that Du Fu was &quot; &lt; unk &gt; ... because ... through all his &lt; unk &gt; , he never for the space of a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; his <unk> &quot; .
His influence was helped by his ability to <unk> apparent <unk> : political &lt; unk &gt; were attracted by his <unk> to the established order , while political radicals <unk> his concern for the poor .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; could look to his technical <unk> , while literary radicals were inspired by his <unk> .
Since the establishment of the People &apos; s Republic of China , Du Fu &apos; s <unk> to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and he has been praised for his use of simple , &quot; people &apos; s language &quot; .
Du Fu &apos; s popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of <unk> in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him .
While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the <unk> of specific aspects of his work : &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s concern for the poor , <unk> You &apos; s <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; on the &lt; unk &gt; are a few examples .
More broadly , Du Fu &apos; s work in <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; from <unk> word play into &quot; a vehicle for serious poetic &lt; unk &gt; &quot; set the stage for every subsequent writer in the <unk> .
In the 20th century , he was the favourite poet of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , who has described him as &quot; the greatest non @ - @ <unk> , non @ - @ dramatic poet who has survived in any language &quot; , and commented that , &quot; he has made me a better man , as a moral agent and as a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; .
= = = <unk> on Japanese literature = = = Du Fu &apos; s poetry has made a <unk> impact on Japanese literature , especially on the literature from the &lt; unk &gt; period and on scholars and poets in the <unk> period , including &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the very greatest of all &lt; unk &gt; poets .
Even in modern Japanese , the term Saint of Poetry ( &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) is mostly <unk> with Du Fu .

The first notable Japanese &lt; unk &gt; of Du Fu &apos; s poetry was &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; – &lt; unk &gt; ) , a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and one of the most prominent <unk> of the literature of the Five <unk> ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in <unk> .

His student &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; composed many &lt; unk &gt; which were clearly stated &quot; influenced by Du Fu &quot; in their &lt; unk &gt; .

&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> , &quot; <unk> if you do have enough <unk> .
No if do not . &quot;
Since then , there had been many &lt; unk &gt; on Du Fu &apos; s poetry both in &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and in the <unk> society , and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the &lt; unk &gt; period , <unk>
, &lt; unk &gt; , a historical <unk> in the late <unk> century , and some &lt; unk &gt; plays such as &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; .
During the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; era of the <unk> period ( <unk> – <unk> ) , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) of the <unk> <unk> &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; on Du Fu &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) was <unk> into Japan , and it gained explosive popularity in Confucian scholars and &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) class .
The commentary established Du Fu &apos; s <unk> as the highest of all poets ; for instance , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , a notable Confucian <unk> , commented in <unk> .
37 of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; that &lt; unk &gt; &#91; Du Fu &#93; was the very best poet in history and praised &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s commentary for its <unk> and <unk> , while he criticized old <unk> during the <unk> <unk> were too &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the greatest &lt; unk &gt; poet , was also strongly influenced by Du Fu ; in &lt; unk &gt; no &lt; unk &gt; , his <unk> , he <unk> the first two lines of A Spring View ( &lt; unk &gt; ) before a &lt; unk &gt; as its introduction and also many of his other &lt; unk &gt; have similar <unk> and themes .

= = &lt; unk &gt; = = A variety of styles have been used in efforts to <unk> Du Fu &apos; s work into English .
As Burton Watson remarks in The <unk> Poems of Du Fu , &quot; There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in <unk> Du Fu , which is why we need as many different translations as possible &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) .
The <unk> have had to <unk> with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without <unk> &lt; unk &gt; to a Western ear ( particularly when <unk> <unk> verse , or &lt; unk &gt; ) , and &lt; unk &gt; the complex <unk> contained particularly in the later works ( <unk> writes that &quot; his poems do not as a rule come through very well in <unk> &quot; — &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) .
One extreme on each issue is represented by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s One <unk> Poems From the Chinese .
His are free translations , which seek to <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; through &lt; unk &gt; and expansion and <unk> of the content ; his <unk> to the <unk> are <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; most of these poems from his selection , and &lt; unk &gt; to &quot; <unk> out &quot; the references in those works which he does <unk> .
Other <unk> have placed much greater weight on trying to <unk> a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu .

In The <unk> Poems of Du Fu , Burton Watson follows the &lt; unk &gt; quite <unk> , <unk> the western <unk> to <unk> to the poems rather than vice <unk> .
Similarly , he <unk> with the <unk> of the later works by <unk> <unk> <unk> with extensive &lt; unk &gt; .

Originally intended to be <unk> of the preceding &lt; unk &gt; class , they were <unk> before construction began .
Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great &lt; unk &gt; earthquake in 1923 .
They were <unk> in 1934 – 37 with <unk> to their armour and <unk> and a rebuilt superstructure in the <unk> <unk> style .
<unk> they played a minor role in the Second &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ Japanese War .
Despite the <unk> <unk> , both vessels were considered obsolete by the <unk> of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war .
Following the loss of most of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @ - @ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of &lt; unk &gt; .
A lack of aircraft and <unk> <unk> , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat .
While <unk> their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases .

The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American <unk> in July .
After the war they were <unk> in 1946 – 47 .
= = Background = = The design of the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval <unk> to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese <unk> waters .
The &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s fleet of battleships had <unk> highly successful in <unk> , the last year of the <unk> @ - @ Japanese War , which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; .
In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial <unk> in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , a Japanese Navy <unk> and military <unk> , <unk> that conflict would <unk> <unk> between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals .
To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy .
This <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , would <unk> the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict .
Accordingly , the <unk> Imperial Defence <unk> called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @ , @ 000 long tons ( 20 @ , @ <unk> t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @ , @ 000 long tons ( 18 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; t ) each .
This was the <unk> of the Eight @ - @ Eight Fleet <unk> , the development of a <unk> battle line of sixteen capital ships .
The launch of HMS &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> by the Royal Navy raised the <unk> , and complicated Japan &apos; s plans .
&lt; unk &gt; 17 @ , @ 900 long tons ( 18 @ , @ 200 t ) and armed with ten 12 @ - @ inch ( 30 @ .
@ 5 cm ) guns , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> all existing battleships obsolete by comparison .
The launch of the <unk> HMS <unk> the following year was a further <unk> for Japan &apos; s <unk> for <unk> .
When the two new &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ class battleships and two &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ class armoured cruisers , launched by 1911 , were &lt; unk &gt; by their British <unk> , the Eight @ - @ Eight Fleet <unk> was &lt; unk &gt; .
The first battleships built for the <unk> Eight @ - @ Eight Fleet <unk> were the two <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; class , ordered in <unk> and laid down in <unk> .
In <unk> , the Navy put forward a request to the <unk> ( <unk> ) to secure funding for the <unk> of the program at once .
Because of economic constraints , only four <unk> and a single battleship of the &lt; unk &gt; class were ultimately approved by the <unk> .
Three more &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ class ships ( &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; ) were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 .
While &lt; unk &gt; was laid down later that year , the &lt; unk &gt; lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; until the <unk> <unk> additional funding for the ships in July 1914 .
= = <unk> and description = = The progress of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s construction , while the &lt; unk &gt; waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ class design .
The <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; gun turrets was the most obvious <unk> as they complicated the protection of the &lt; unk &gt; magazine and exposed more of the ship to the <unk> effects of the guns when they fired .
Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45 @ .
@ 36 @ - @ <unk> ( 100 @ .
@ 0 lb ) shells used in the <unk> loaded <unk> @ - @ millimetre ( 6 in ) secondary guns used in the &lt; unk &gt; class and earlier designs .
To <unk> this issue , the &lt; unk &gt; designed a smaller 140 @ - @ millimetre ( 5 @ .
@ 5 in ) gun that <unk> its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire .
It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a <unk> increase in speed to partially counter the higher <unk> of the latest foreign ships like the British <unk> <unk> @ - @ class battleships and Russian &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ class <unk> .
For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was <unk> slightly and the <unk> rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @ .
@ 5 knots ( 0 @ .
@ 93 km / h ; 0 @ .
@ 58 mph ) to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) .
To save weight the <unk> deck was <unk> so that the lower &lt; unk &gt; gun turret was lower than in the &lt; unk &gt; class .
This reduced the crew &apos; s <unk> despite a significant increase in the crew &apos; s numbers and naval historian &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; believed that these ships had the worst &lt; unk &gt; of any Japanese capital ship .
The final design was designated A @ - @ 92 by the &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> enough from the A @ - @ 64 design of the &lt; unk &gt; class that it was considered a separate class .

The other carrier air groups were not in much better shape and the Japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the American carriers .
The Fourth <unk> Division was assigned to the Northern Force under the command of Vice Admiral &lt; unk &gt; Ozawa and the sisters sailed from &lt; unk &gt; on 20 October .
On the morning of 24 October , the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the American carriers as a <unk> .
They inflicted no damage and caused the Americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked .
The Americans finally <unk> the Japanese carriers at 16 : 40 , some 200 miles ( <unk> km ) east of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , the <unk> tip of Luzon .

It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously .
The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( <unk> ) troops <unk> a strong North Korean attack .
After the First Battle of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the US Army &apos; s 2nd Infantry Division was moved to defend the &lt; unk &gt; River line .
The division , which was &lt; unk &gt; in combat , was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the Korean People &apos; s Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division &apos; s line .
The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half , and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> a fight there .
The <unk> of the threat to Pusan Perimeter prompted the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to be brought in to <unk> the US Army troops .
In two weeks of heavy fighting , the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; region .
The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN <unk> at &lt; unk &gt; , which culminated in the <unk> destruction of the North Korean army .
= = Background = = = = = Pusan Perimeter = = = From the <unk> of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People &apos; s Army had enjoyed <unk> in both <unk> and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from <unk> .
The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and <unk> forces on all <unk> of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and <unk> a double &lt; unk &gt; of both <unk> of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to <unk> and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in &lt; unk &gt; , often leaving behind much of its equipment .
From their initial June 25 offensive to <unk> in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south .
However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the <unk> which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers <unk> daily as the superior UN <unk> system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army .
When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main <unk> of approach into the perimeter .
Throughout August , the &lt; unk &gt; 6th Division , and later the &lt; unk &gt; 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; , initially &lt; unk &gt; a UN <unk> before &lt; unk &gt; with battles at &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; and Battle Mountain .
These attacks <unk> as UN forces , well equipped and with <unk> of reserves , repeatedly <unk> North Korean attacks .
North of &lt; unk &gt; , the &lt; unk &gt; 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division &lt; unk &gt; in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; area .
In the First Battle of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the North Korean division was unable to hold its <unk> across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to <unk> it , and on August 19 , the &lt; unk &gt; 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties .
In the &lt; unk &gt; region , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; where the &lt; unk &gt; 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack .
On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at <unk> &apos; <unk> @ - @ <unk> during the Battle of <unk> &apos; <unk> @ - @ <unk> .
All along the front , the North Korean troops were &lt; unk &gt; from these <unk> , the first time in the war their <unk> were not working .
= = = September push = = = In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible <unk> to the support of the UN navy .
Instead , they <unk> to use frontal attack to <unk> the perimeter and collapse it as the only <unk> of <unk> success in the battle .
&lt; unk &gt; by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle .
A secondary objective was to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and destroy the UN and <unk> units in that city .
As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to &lt; unk &gt; .
On August 20 , the North Korean <unk> <unk> operations orders to their <unk> units .
The North Koreans called for a <unk> five @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; attack against the UN lines .
These attacks would <unk> the UN <unk> and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back .
Five battle <unk> were ordered .
The center attack called for the &lt; unk &gt; 9th Division , &lt; unk &gt; 4th Division , &lt; unk &gt; 2nd Division , and &lt; unk &gt; 10th Division break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
= = Battle = = During the North Koreans &apos; September 1 offensive , the US 25th Infantry Division &apos; s US <unk> Infantry Regiment was heavily engaged in the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; River north of &lt; unk &gt; .
On the <unk> Regiment &apos; s right flank , just north of the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; River and the &lt; unk &gt; River , was the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division .
There , in the <unk> part of the 2nd Infantry Division zone , the 9th Infantry Regiment held a sector more than 20 @ , @ 000 yards ( 18 @ , @ 000 m ) long , including the &lt; unk &gt; area of the &lt; unk &gt; where the First Battle of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; had taken place earlier in August .
Each US infantry company on the river line here had a front of 3 @ , @ 000 feet ( <unk> m ) to 4 @ , @ 000 feet ( 1 @ , @ 200 m ) and they held only key hills and observation points , as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front .
During the last week of August , US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river , which they thought was North Koreans <unk> the high ground on the west side of the &lt; unk &gt; against a possible American attack .
There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry &apos; s forward positions , but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action .
On August 31 , the UN forces were <unk> to a <unk> attack when much of the Korean civilian <unk> force <unk> the front lines .
Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming .
On the west side of the &lt; unk &gt; , North Korean Major General &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Sam , commanding the &lt; unk &gt; 9th Division , issued his operations order to the division on August 28 .
Its mission in the <unk> attack was to <unk> and destroy the US troops at &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; by capturing the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; areas to cut off the US 2nd Division &apos; s route of supply and <unk> between &lt; unk &gt; and Pusan .
However , the North Koreans <unk> &apos; t aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along the &lt; unk &gt; River .
Consequently , they expected lighter resistance ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea .
They had only recently been moved into the line .
The North Koreans began crossing the &lt; unk &gt; River under cover of darkness at certain points .
= = = Battle of &lt; unk &gt; = = = On the southern @ - @ most flank of the 9th Infantry river line , just above the junction of the &lt; unk &gt; River with the &lt; unk &gt; , A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on a long <unk> ridge &lt; unk &gt; the &lt; unk &gt; that <unk> in Hill 94 at the &lt; unk &gt; ferry site .
The river road from &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ <unk> running west along the &lt; unk &gt; passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry .
A small village called &lt; unk &gt; lay at the base of Hill 94 and 300 yards ( 270 m ) from the river .
A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads of A Company , 9th Infantry , held a <unk> near the ferry and close to &lt; unk &gt; .
On the evening of August 31 , A Company moved from its ridge positions overlooking &lt; unk &gt; and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line .
That evening Sergeant Ernest R. &lt; unk &gt; led the patrol of two &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; tanks and two &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; placed his patrol on the west side of &lt; unk &gt; near the &lt; unk &gt; ferry .
At 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and at 22 : 00 mortar shells began falling on the American @ - @ held side of the river .
By 22 : 15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company &apos; s positions .
American mortars and artillery began firing &lt; unk &gt; .
Some of the A Company men reported they heard <unk> on the opposite side of the river and <unk> in the water .
At 22 : 30 the fog lifted and &lt; unk &gt; saw that a North Korean &lt; unk &gt; bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s four vehicles attacked this structure , and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed , and the &lt; unk &gt; boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk .
At 23 : 00 a small arms fight <unk> around the left side of A Company north of the tanks .
This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company <unk> squads near the tanks received word by field <unk> that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s patrol was then <unk> by a group of North Koreans <unk> in US military <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held the &lt; unk &gt; site until 07 : 30 the next morning with his single tank .
In the attack against A Company , the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon , which was near &lt; unk &gt; , but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward .
The &lt; unk &gt; 9th Division &apos; s infantry crossing of the &lt; unk &gt; and attack on its east side near midnight quickly <unk> the positions of C Company , north of A Company .
There the North Koreans <unk> in force , <unk> by green <unk> and <unk> of <unk> .
The company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape .
Many of the men moved south , a few of them coming into A Company &apos; s ridge line positions near &lt; unk &gt; during the night .
Most of C Company moved all the way to the 25th Division positions south of the &lt; unk &gt; .
On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines .

@ 0 km ) north of &lt; unk &gt; and A Company &apos; s position , B Company , 9th Infantry , held a similar position on Hill &lt; unk &gt; overlooking the &lt; unk &gt; ferry crossing of the river .
This ferry was located at the middle of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; where the &lt; unk &gt; road came down to the &lt; unk &gt; and crossed it .
The US 2nd Infantry Division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of August 31 , the same night that the &lt; unk &gt; I Corps offensive <unk> across the river .
<unk> the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th Infantry had crossed to the west side of the &lt; unk &gt; and observed North Korean tank and troop activity 2 miles ( 3 @ .
@ 2 km ) west of the river .

&lt; unk &gt; , which in turn had received instructions from Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General <unk> Walker for <unk> <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; decided the patrol should cross the river at the &lt; unk &gt; ferry .
The 9th Infantry reserve , E Company , reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company , was to be the attack force .
The 1st Platoon , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of August 31 .
Two heavy weapons companies , D and H , were each to &lt; unk &gt; one section of heavy machine guns , one section of 81 @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; mortars , and one section of 75 @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> for supporting fires .
A platoon of 4 @ .
@ 2 @ - @ inch mortars was also to give support .
After dark on August 31 , First Lieutenant Charles I. <unk> of D Company and First Lieutenant Edward &lt; unk &gt; of H Company , 9th Infantry , moved their men and weapons to the base of Hill &lt; unk &gt; , which was within B Company &apos; s defense sector and <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; ferry crossing of the &lt; unk &gt; River .
The <unk> force , E Company , was still in its regimental reserve position about 2 miles ( 3 @ .
@ 2 km ) west of &lt; unk &gt; , getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site .
Colonel Hill went forward in the evening with the 4 @ .
@ 2 @ - @ inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of Hill &lt; unk &gt; where the &lt; unk &gt; prepared to set up their weapons .
By 21 : 00 , the closest front line unit was B Company on top of Hill &lt; unk &gt; , 1 mile ( 1 @ .
@ 6 km ) north of the river road which <unk> around the hill &apos; s southern base .
The regimental &lt; unk &gt; , Captain <unk> <unk> <unk> , had <unk> forward in the afternoon to B Company to hold services .
On top of Hill &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and men in B Company after dark heard &lt; unk &gt; in the water below them .
They soon discovered a long line of North Korean soldiers <unk> the river .
The first North Korean crossing at the &lt; unk &gt; ferry caught the Heavy &lt; unk &gt; Platoon <unk> in the act of setting up its weapons .
It also caught most of the D and H Company men at the base of Hill &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; miles ( 0 @ .
@ 80 km ) from the crossing site .
The North Koreans killed or captured many of the troops there .
Hill was there , but escaped to the rear just before midnight , together with several others , when the division <unk> Operation &lt; unk &gt; because of the attacks .
The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the North Korean attack &lt; unk &gt; the men below .
It &lt; unk &gt; on to the top where the advance group waited and there all <unk> dug in on a small perimeter .
This group was not attacked during the night .
From 21 : 30 until shortly after midnight the &lt; unk &gt; 9th Division crossed the &lt; unk &gt; at a number of places and <unk> the hills <unk> toward the 9th Infantry river line positions .
Then , when the artillery <unk> preparation lifted , the North Korean infantry were in position to launch their <unk> .
These began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward .
At each crossing site the North Koreans would <unk> local UN <unk> before building &lt; unk &gt; bridges for their vehicles and armor .
At 02 : 00 , B Company was attacked .
A truck stopped at the bottom of the hill , a <unk> <unk> , then came a <unk> order , and North Korean soldiers started <unk> the <unk> .
The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill <unk> , a <unk> terrain feature a 1 @ .
@ 5 miles ( 2 @ .
@ 4 km ) from the river and the North Koreans &apos; principal immediate objective .
The North Koreans apparently were not aware of the Task Force &lt; unk &gt; group lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during the night .
But higher up on Hill &lt; unk &gt; the North Koreans drove B Company from its position , <unk> very heavy casualties on it .
<unk> led one group of soldiers back to friendly lines on 4 September .
At 03 : 00 , 1 September , the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve , E Company to move west along the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; River road and take a <unk> position at the pass between &lt; unk &gt; Hill and &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Ridge , 3 miles ( 4 @ .
@ 8 km ) from the river and 6 miles ( 9 @ .
@ 7 km ) from &lt; unk &gt; .
This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Fighting began at the pass at 02 : 30 when an American medium tank of A Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , knocked out a T @ - @ 34 at &lt; unk &gt; , also called &lt; unk &gt; .
E Company never reached its <unk> position .
A strong North Korean force <unk> and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at 03 : 30 from positions &lt; unk &gt; the road east of the pass .
The company suffered heavy casualties , including the company commander and &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> who had accompanied the force .
With the critical parts of &lt; unk &gt; Hill and &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Ridge , the best defensive terrain between &lt; unk &gt; and the river , the North Koreans controlled the high ground .
The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense of &lt; unk &gt; on relatively poor defensive terrain , the low hills at the western edge of the town .

On August 1 , the 23rd Regiment was in a new sector of which it had only a limited knowledge .
It took over a 16 @ , @ 000 yards ( 15 @ , @ 000 m ) &lt; unk &gt; River front without its 3rd Battalion which had been attached to the US 1st <unk> Division to the north .
Colonel Paul <unk> Freeman , the regimental commander , deployed the 1st Battalion on the high ground along the river with the three companies <unk> .
The 1st Battalion , under US Lieutenant Colonel <unk> E. &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> .
, &lt; unk &gt; the hills with <unk> and squads .
He placed the 2nd Battalion in a reserve position 8 miles ( 13 km ) behind the 1st Battalion and in a position where it commanded the road net in the regimental sector .
On August &lt; unk &gt; the 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry sector .
Two roads ran through the regimental sector from the &lt; unk &gt; River to &lt; unk &gt; .
The main road <unk> south along the east bank of the river to &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; and then turned northeast to &lt; unk &gt; .
A northern secondary road <unk> around &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> , the largest of which was Lake U @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , to &lt; unk &gt; .
In effect , the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment <unk> these two approach routes to &lt; unk &gt; .
The 42 men of the 2nd Platoon , B Company , 23rd Infantry held <unk> positions on seven hills covering a 2 @ , @ 600 yards ( 2 @ , @ 400 m ) front along the east bank of the &lt; unk &gt; north of &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; .
Across the river in the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; they could see , in the afternoon of August 31 , two large groups of North Korean soldiers .

Just before dark , the platoon saw a column of North Koreans come out of the hills and proceed toward the river .
They immediately reported to the battalion command post .
The artillery forward <unk> , who estimated the column at 2 @ , @ 000 people , thought they were <unk> .
Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column , reducing its number .
However the North Koreans continued their advance .
At 21 : 00 the first shells of what proved to be a two @ - @ hour North Korean artillery and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon .
As the <unk> <unk> on , North Korean infantry crossed the river and <unk> the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire .
At 23 : 00 the <unk> lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon , forcing it from the hill after a short fight .

On the regimental left along the main &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; road North Korean soldiers completely <unk> C Company by <unk> September 1 .
Only seven men of C Company could be <unk> for , and three days later , after all the <unk> and those cut off behind North Korean lines had come in , there were only 20 men in the company .
As the North Korean attack developed during the night , 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force , less C Company , just north of Lake U @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and the hills there covering the northern road into &lt; unk &gt; , 3 miles ( 4 @ .
@ 8 km ) east of the river and 5 miles ( 8 @ .

B Company lost heavily in this action .
When word of the <unk> that had &lt; unk &gt; 1st Battalion reached regimental headquarters , Freeman obtained the release of <unk> and F <unk> from 2nd Division reserve and sent the former to help 1st Battalion and the latter on the southern road toward &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; and C Company .
Major <unk> <unk> <unk> , executive officer of the 2nd Battalion , accompanied F Company down the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; road .

The US 2nd Division released E Company to the regiment and the next day it joined F Company to build up what became the main defensive position of the &lt; unk &gt; Regiment in front of &lt; unk &gt; .
North Korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st Battalion &apos; s northern <unk> position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions .
The 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Service <unk> and other &lt; unk &gt; regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post 5 miles ( 8 @ .

&lt; unk &gt; decided that this situation made it &lt; unk &gt; to control and direct the divided division as two special forces .
Accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , <unk> General <unk> M. Haynes , in command of the northern group .
Haynes &apos; command post was 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of &lt; unk &gt; .
Task Force Haynes became operational at 10 : 20 , September 1 .

The &lt; unk &gt; 2nd Division , concentrated in the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; area west of the river , had , in effect , attacked straight east across the river and was trying to <unk> the two <unk> of advance into &lt; unk &gt; above and below Lake U @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
On August 31 , 1950 , Lake U @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; was a large body of water although in most places very shallow .

The massive North Korean attack had made deep &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry .
The &lt; unk &gt; 9th Division had <unk> major &lt; unk &gt; of the &lt; unk &gt; at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry ; the &lt; unk &gt; 2nd Division in the <unk> had made three major &lt; unk &gt; against the US 23rd Infantry ; and the &lt; unk &gt; 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill &lt; unk &gt; area near &lt; unk &gt; &apos; <unk> in the US 38th Infantry sector .
At 08 : 10 &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Eighth Army headquarters and reported the heaviest and <unk> North Korean &lt; unk &gt; were in the 9th Infantry sector .

He wanted the Air Force to <unk> the <unk> and prevent further North Korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the North Korean <unk> units .
The Far East Command requested the US Navy to join in the air effort , and the US <unk> Fleet turned back from its strikes in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ <unk> area and &lt; unk &gt; southward at full steam toward the southern battle front .
Walker came to the US 2nd Division front at 12 : 00 and ordered the division to hold at all costs .
He had already ordered ground reinforcements to the &lt; unk &gt; area .
During the morning of 1 September , Walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front , &lt; unk &gt; in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his Pusan Perimeter reserves .

As the morning passed , General Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; area of the US 2nd Division sector .
There the North Koreans <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and with it the entire Eighth Army position .
At 11 : 00 Walker ordered US Marine Corps <unk> General Edward A. Craig , commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade , to prepare the marines to move at once .

The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the &lt; unk &gt; ferry , captured &lt; unk &gt; , and scattered A Company , 9th Infantry at its positions from &lt; unk &gt; northward .
A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river .
From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers on many of the <unk> surrounding them , most of them moving east .
After several hours , 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill to &lt; unk &gt; to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night , returning later with much needed water , <unk> , and ammunition .
Later in the morning North Korean <unk> crossed the &lt; unk &gt; below A Company .
The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking &lt; unk &gt; to take these troops under fire .
When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base .
The company hit these houses with artillery .
The North Koreans broke from the houses , running for the river .
At this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire , as did another across the &lt; unk &gt; to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; artillery fire <unk> this group .

In the afternoon , US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company ; only part of it was recovered .
The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night .
During the withdraw , however , A Company ran into a <unk> North Korean force and had scattered in the <unk> fight .
Most of the company , including its commander were killed at close range .
In this <unk> action , <unk> First Class <unk> H. Story , a weapons squad leader , fought so &lt; unk &gt; that he was awarded the <unk> of <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; wounded , Story refused to be a <unk> to those who might escape , and when last seen was still <unk> North Korean at close range .
Of those in the company , approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines .
The next morning , under heavy fog , the group made its way by &lt; unk &gt; toward &lt; unk &gt; .
From a hill at 12 : 00 , after the fog had lifted , the men looked down on the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; which was then in progress .
That afternoon 20 survivors of the company <unk> into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near &lt; unk &gt; .

During the night &lt; unk &gt; established radio communication with the 1st Battalion , 9th infantry .
When daylight came &lt; unk &gt; and his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans .
One force occupied the higher &lt; unk &gt; half a mile above them , formerly held by B Company .
Below them , North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units , some of them already several miles eastward .
The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force &lt; unk &gt; group .
They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed .
That night an estimated company attacked three times , <unk> the fight to close <unk> , but failed each time to penetrate the <unk> US perimeter .

In the afternoon of September 2 &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; 1st Battalion for an &lt; unk &gt; of supplies .
A US plane attempted the <unk> , but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so <unk> that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands .
The men in the perimeter did , however , <unk> from a <unk> made later at 19 : 00 some supplies and ammunition .

On several occasions he was attacked , and on one such <unk> a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked &lt; unk &gt; , who killed the North Korean in hand @ - @ to @ - @ hand combat .
That same afternoon , the North Koreans sent an American <unk> up the hill to &lt; unk &gt; with the <unk> , &quot; You have one hour to <unk> or be blown to pieces . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire .
Only 45 minutes later North Korean &lt; unk &gt; fire came in on the &lt; unk &gt; and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the <unk> of Hill &lt; unk &gt; swept the perimeter .
Soon , mortars &lt; unk &gt; on a <unk> high <unk> ridge eastward registered on &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s perimeter and continued firing until dark .
The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his &lt; unk &gt; .
The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the <unk> for <unk> North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed .
But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were <unk> .
There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man .
The third day , September 3 , the situation <unk> .
The weather was <unk> and ammunition , food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted .
Since the previous afternoon , North Korean mortar &lt; unk &gt; had <unk> with infantry <unk> against the perimeter .
&lt; unk &gt; later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed .
Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter <unk> anyone showed himself .
Dead and <unk> US troops were in almost every &lt; unk &gt; .

Most of the &lt; unk &gt; of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire .
One of these killed &lt; unk &gt; on September 3 .
The command passed now to First Lieutenant <unk> <unk>
&lt; unk &gt; of D Company , senior surviving officer .
At daylight on the morning of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill , were alive .
As the day passed , with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight , &lt; unk &gt; decided to <unk> the position that night .
When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines .
That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position .
At 22 : 00 , &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> and 27 enlisted men <unk> off the hill in groups of four .
<unk> Sergeant <unk> E. <unk> , still alive in his &lt; unk &gt; condition , refused efforts of evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a <unk> to those who had a chance to get away .
He asked only that his &lt; unk &gt; be loaded and placed on his <unk> with the muzzle under his <unk> .
Like &lt; unk &gt; , he would also win the <unk> of <unk> for his actions .
Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4 , 22 escaped to friendly lines , many of them following the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , <unk> by day and <unk> by night , until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division .
Members of Task Force &lt; unk &gt; who escaped from Hill &lt; unk &gt; brought back considerable intelligence information of North Korean activity in the vicinity of the &lt; unk &gt; ferry crossing site .
At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge .

North Koreans were in &lt; unk &gt; that evening .
With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry , Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the &lt; unk &gt; road in an effort to re @ - @ establish communication .
C Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , led its tanks southward .
They had to fight their way down the road through several <unk> .
Of the three tanks that started , only the lead tank got through to &lt; unk &gt; .
There , it delivered an &lt; unk &gt; of Task Force Haynes &apos; positions to Bradley .

After the North Korean <unk> during the night of August 31 , &lt; unk &gt; had ordered the 2nd Battalion , 38th Infantry , to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of &lt; unk &gt; .
In attempting to do this , the battalion found North Korean troops already on the <unk> along the road .
They had <unk> to Hill &lt; unk &gt; overlooking the 38th Infantry command post .
This hill and Hill &lt; unk &gt; dominated the rear areas of the regiment .
At 06 : 00 September 3 , 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill &lt; unk &gt; against the 38th Regiment command post .
The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy <unk> and his defense perimeter were too close to each other .
But the Air Force did deliver <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; strikes .
This fight continued until September 5 .
On that day F Company captured Hill &lt; unk &gt; killing 150 North Koreans .
From the <unk> he and his men watched as many more North Koreans ran into a village below them .

On September 1 the regiment ordered it to withdraw to the &lt; unk &gt; area .
At 14 : 00 a tank @ - @ infantry patrol was sent down the road , but it reported that an estimated North Korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward of the battalion &apos; s defense perimeter .
Upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position and try to <unk> the movement of North Korean reinforcements and supplies .
That evening Freeman approved this request , and 1st Battalion spent three days in the isolated positions .
During this time C @ - @ 47 &lt; unk &gt; planes <unk> the battalion by &lt; unk &gt; .
On the morning of September 1 , 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; to open the road to the 1st Battalion .
On the second day of the fighting at the pass , the relief force broke through the <unk> with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire .
The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17 : 00 September 2 .
That evening , North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry , on Hill &lt; unk &gt; north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion , driving one company from its position .
On September 4 , Haynes changed the <unk> between the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments , giving the northern part of the 23rd &apos; s sector to the 38th Infantry , thus releasing 1st Battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to &lt; unk &gt; .
The 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , about 1 @ , @ 100 men strong when the attack began , was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men .
The 23rd Infantry now made plans to <unk> all its troops on the position held by its 2nd Battalion on the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; road .
The 1st Battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd Battalion .
At the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position .

The 3rd Regiment had been left at &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , but division commander Major General &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Sam felt the <unk> of capturing &lt; unk &gt; were strong .
On the morning of September 1 , with only the <unk> remnants of E Company at hand , the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; in this <unk> attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment .
The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to &lt; unk &gt; .
The regimental commander planned to place the <unk> on the <unk> of low hills that <unk> around &lt; unk &gt; on the northwest .

A platoon of infantry went into position behind it .
A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of &lt; unk &gt; on the left flank of D Company .
There , A Company went into position along the road ; on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion , and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company .
The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town .
The road to &lt; unk &gt; came south out of &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> around the western tip of this mountain , and then ran eastward along its southern base .
In its position , D Company not only commanded the town but also its <unk> , the road to &lt; unk &gt; .
North Koreans had also approached &lt; unk &gt; from the south .
The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in a <unk> fight .
In this action , Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself .
He mounted a tank , operated its exposed turret machine gun , and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven North Korean machine guns .
Turner and this tank came under heavy North Korean fire which shot away the tank &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; and scored more than 50 hits on it .
Turner , although wounded , remained on the tank until he was killed .
That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around &lt; unk &gt; and entered the town from the south .

He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the <unk> between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry <unk> .
He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them .
He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward &lt; unk &gt; but had not yet released them for <unk> there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas <unk> approved his use of them , since he knew that this would <unk> with other plans of the Far East Command .
Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them .
&lt; unk &gt; replied that <unk> had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary .
A few hours after this <unk> Walker , at 13 : 15 , attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co @ - @ <unk> attack by all available elements of the division and the marines , with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the &lt; unk &gt; River in the 2nd Division sector and of <unk> the river line .
The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was <unk> .
A decision was reached that the marines would attack west at 08 : 00 on September 3 &lt; unk &gt; the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; River road ; the 9th Infantry , B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and D <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re @ - @ establish contact with the US 23rd Infantry ; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , remnants of the 1st Battalion , 9th Infantry , and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank , or south , of the marines to <unk> contact with the 25th Division .

There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone .
The American <unk> of September 3 – 5 west of &lt; unk &gt; , according to <unk> <unk> , resulted in one of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of the war for a North Korean division .

The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops .
<unk> came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost <unk> stream during the morning .
All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points .
At one time , the regimental reserve was down to six men .
When the attack finally <unk> shortly after 12 : 00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent .
This heavy night and day battle cost the &lt; unk &gt; 2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength .

Most of the North Korean units began <unk> <unk> actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea .
The North Koreans withdrew from the &lt; unk &gt; area first , the night of September 18 – 19 .
After the forces there , the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North .
The US units rapidly pursued them north , passing over the &lt; unk &gt; River positions , which were no longer of strategic importance .

All of &lt; unk &gt; II Corps was in a similar state , and the North Korean army , exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after &lt; unk &gt; , was on the <unk> of defeat .
By this time , the US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1 @ , @ 120 killed , 2 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; wounded , 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter .

American forces were <unk> repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter .
The division had numbered 17 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; on September 1 , but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties .
The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , most of which probably occurred at &lt; unk &gt; .
Of all the North Korean attacks along the Pusan Perimeter , the Second Battle of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; is seen by historians as the most serious threat .

However , once again the <unk> weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an <unk> initial success — its communications and supply were not capable of &lt; unk &gt; a <unk> and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air , armor , and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points .
By September 8 , the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed .

( 2016 ) = &lt; unk &gt; warship = An ironclad is a steam @ - @ propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century .
The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or <unk> shells .
The first ironclad battleship , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 .
The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since <unk> and prepared a draft design for an armored &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @ - @ armored battle fleet .
After the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the &lt; unk &gt; ship of the line as the most powerful warship <unk> .
This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War .
&lt; unk &gt; were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @ - @ range cruisers .
The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; vessel that carried <unk> to <unk> its steam engines into the steel @ - @ built , &lt; unk &gt; battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century .
This change was pushed forward by the development of <unk> naval guns ( the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea ) , more <unk> steam engines , and advances in <unk> which made steel <unk> possible .
The quick <unk> of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were in a state of <unk> .
Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval <unk> considered the important weapons of naval combat .
There is no clear end to the ironclad period , but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use .
New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers .
= = The ironclad = = The ironclad became <unk> <unk> and <unk> necessary because of developments in <unk> in the first half of the 19th century .
According to naval historian <unk> Richard Hill : &quot; The ( ironclad ) had three chief characteristics : a metal @ - @ <unk> hull , steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells .
It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can <unk> be called an ironclad . &quot;
Each of these developments was introduced <unk> in the decade before the first ironclads .
= = = <unk> propulsion = = = In the <unk> and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship , the ship of the line and the frigate .
The first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion .
While &lt; unk &gt; <unk> warships had been used from the <unk> onwards , steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s .
<unk> @ - @ powered screw frigates were built in the mid @ - @ 1840s , and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle .
The desire for change came from the <unk> of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe , which required a challenge to the British at sea .
The first purpose @ - @ built steam battleship was the 90 @ - @ gun <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> was armed as a conventional ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line , but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , <unk> of the wind conditions : a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement .
The introduction of the steam ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line led to a building competition between France and Britain .
Eight sister ships to <unk> were built in France over a period of ten years , but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production .
&lt; unk &gt; , France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line , while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41 .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; shells = = = The era of the wooden steam ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns .
In the <unk> and <unk> , warships began to <unk> increasingly heavy guns , replacing <unk> and 24 @ - @ pounder guns with 32 @ - @ pounders on sailing ships @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line and <unk> 68 @ - @ pounders on &lt; unk &gt; .
Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French &lt; unk &gt; <unk> @ - @ Joseph &lt; unk &gt; , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy .
It is often held that the power of explosive shells to <unk> wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an <unk> squadron at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> the end of the wooden @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; warship .
The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @ - @ <unk> shot , which could &lt; unk &gt; in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion .
Some navies even <unk> with <unk> shot filled with <unk> metal for extra <unk> power .
= = = Iron armor = = = The use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships &apos; hulls began in the <unk> ; the first &quot; warship &quot; with an iron hull was the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , built by <unk> for the East India Company in <unk> .
There followed , also from <unk> , the first full @ - @ blown warships with metal hulls , the <unk> steam frigates &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; for the Mexican navy .
But a thin iron skin , while not being <unk> to fire or <unk> &lt; unk &gt; like wood , was not the same thing as providing iron armor <unk> to stop enemy gunfire .
Following the <unk> of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; , and <unk> that his own ships would be vulnerable to the &lt; unk &gt; guns of Russian fortifications in the <unk> War , Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of light @ - @ draft floating batteries , equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor .
<unk> made during the first half of <unk> proved highly <unk> , and on 17 July <unk> , the French <unk> to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun @ - @ <unk> vessels and that plans would be <unk> .
After <unk> in September <unk> , the British Admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the French plans , <unk> the important <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; Iron Works within the <unk> .
The French floating batteries were deployed in <unk> as a <unk> to the wooden steam battle fleet in the <unk> War .
The role of the battery was to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; mortar and <unk> <unk> shore fortifications .
The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ) in <unk> against the <unk> at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; on the Black Sea , where they were effective against Russian shore defences .
They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859 .
The British floating batteries &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> arrived too late to participate to the action at &lt; unk &gt; .
The British planned to use <unk> in the Baltic Sea against the well @ - @ <unk> naval base at &lt; unk &gt; .
The batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only 4 knots ( 7 km / h ) under their own power : they operated under their own power at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; , but had to be <unk> for long range <unk> .
They were also <unk> <unk> to the work of the navy .
The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begin work on armored warships for their &lt; unk &gt; .
= = Early ironclad ships and battles = = By the end of the <unk> it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships , and to <unk> the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required .
The result was the first ocean @ - @ going ironclad , the Gloire , begun in <unk> and launched in 1859 .
Gloire &apos; s wooden hull was <unk> on that of a steam ship of the line , reduced to one deck , &lt; unk &gt; in iron plates 4 @ .
@ 5 inches ( 110 mm ) thick .
She was propelled by a steam engine , driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ) .
She was armed with thirty @ - @ six 6 @ .
@ 4 @ - @ inch ( 160 mm ) <unk> guns .
France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships , including two more sister ships to Gloire , and the only two @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; broadside ironclads ever built , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
The Royal Navy had not been keen to <unk> its advantage in steam ships of the line , but was determined that the first British ironclad would &lt; unk &gt; the French ships in every <unk> , particularly speed .
A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to <unk> a range of engagement which could make her &lt; unk &gt; to enemy fire .
The British <unk> was more a large , powerful frigate than a ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line .
The <unk> for speed meant a very long vessel , which had to be built from iron .
The result was the construction of two Warrior @ - @ class ironclads ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince .
The ships had a successful design , though there were <unk> <unk> between &apos; sea @ - @ keeping &apos; , strategic range and armour protection ; their weapons were more effective than that of Gloire , and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14 @ .
@ 3 knots ( 26 @ .
@ 5 km / h ) .
<unk> the Gloire and her sisters had full iron @ - @ armour protection along the <unk> and the battery itself .
Warrior and Black Prince ( but also the smaller Defence and <unk> ) were <unk> to <unk> their armour in a central &apos; <unk> &apos; or &apos; armoured box &apos; , leaving many main deck guns and the <unk> and aft sections of the vessel <unk> .
The use of iron in the construction of Warrior also came with some <unk> ; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; by <unk> life .
By 1862 , navies across Europe had adopted ironclads .
Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction , though the British vessels were larger .
Austria , Italy , Russia , and Spain were also building ironclads .
However , the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France , and involved ships <unk> different from the broadside @ - @ firing , &lt; unk &gt; designs of Gloire and Warrior .
The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War , and the <unk> of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; , had an important influence on the development of ironclad design .
= = = First battles between ironclads : the U.S. Civil War = = = The first use of ironclads in action came in the U.S. Civil War .
The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads , its most powerful ships being six steam @ - @ powered &lt; unk &gt; frigates .
Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union , the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by <unk> modern armored ships .
In May 1861 , the Confederate Congress voted that $ 2 million be <unk> for the purchase of ironclads from overseas , and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and <unk> wooden ships .
On 12 October 1861 , the CSS &lt; unk &gt; became the first ironclad to enter combat , when she fought Union warships on the <unk> during the Battle of the Head of &lt; unk &gt; .
She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New <unk> for river and coastal fighting .
In February 1862 , the larger CSS Virginia joined the Confederate Navy , having been rebuilt at <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; on the hull of USS &lt; unk &gt; , Virginia originally was a conventional warship made of wood , but she was converted into an iron @ - @ covered casemate ironclad &lt; unk &gt; , when she entered the Confederate navy .
By this time , the Union had completed seven ironclad <unk> of the City class , and was about to complete the USS &lt; unk &gt; , an <unk> design proposed by the <unk> <unk> John <unk> .
The Union was also building a large armored frigate , the USS New &lt; unk &gt; , and the smaller USS &lt; unk &gt; .
The first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862 , as the armored &lt; unk &gt; was deployed to protect the Union &apos; s wooden fleet from the ironclad ram Virginia and other Confederate warships .
In this engagement , the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads , the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells <unk> off their armor .
The battle attracted attention worldwide , making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date , with the ironclads destroying them easily .
The Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides , and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the &lt; unk &gt; warships , commerce <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The Union built a large fleet of fifty monitors <unk> on their <unk> .
The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of the Virginia , many of which saw action , but their attempts to <unk> ironclads overseas were <unk> as European nations <unk> ships being built for the Confederacy — especially in Russia , the only country to openly support the Union through the war .
Only CSS &lt; unk &gt; was completed , and she arrived in American waters just in time for the end of the war .
Through the remainder of the war , ironclads saw action in the Union &apos; s attacks on Confederate ports .
<unk> Union monitors , including USS &lt; unk &gt; , as well as two other ironclads , the ironclad frigate New &lt; unk &gt; and a light @ - @ draft USS &lt; unk &gt; , participated in the failed attack on <unk> ; one was sunk .
Two small ironclads , CSS &lt; unk &gt; State and CSS &lt; unk &gt; participated in the defence of the <unk> .
For the later attack at <unk> Bay , the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships , facing the CSS <unk> , the Confederacy &apos; s most powerful ironclad and the <unk> CSS <unk> , CSS <unk> , CSS <unk> .
On the western front , the Union built a <unk> force of river ironclads , beginning with several converted &lt; unk &gt; and then <unk> engineer James &lt; unk &gt; of St. Louis , <unk> to build the City @ - @ class ironclads .
These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , all protected by an armored &lt; unk &gt; .
They had a shallow draft , allowing them to journey up smaller <unk> , and were very well suited for river operations .
&lt; unk &gt; also produced monitors for use on the <unk> , the first two of which <unk> from the ocean @ - @ going monitors in that they contained a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> ( the USS &lt; unk &gt; and USS <unk> ) .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; vessels were some of the better ironclads of the Western Flotilla , but there were a number of other vessels that served &lt; unk &gt; with the fleet .
All were of <unk> design , some more successful than others , and some were similar to standard &lt; unk &gt; but with armored side @ - @ mounted &lt; unk &gt; wheels .
All were armed with various smoothbore and some <unk> guns .
If nothing else the experience of the American Civil War and its <unk> variety of <unk> ironclad designs , some more successful ( or <unk> ) than others , confirmed the <unk> trade @ - @ off or <unk> required in <unk> the latest <unk> advances in iron armour manufacture , ship construction and gun design — to name a few — also going on in Europe .
There was no such thing as a &apos; perfect &apos; ironclad which could be &lt; unk &gt; in every possible encounter ; ship <unk> , standing up to <unk> , <unk> &amp; Blue @ - @ water operations .
The Union ironclads played an important role in the <unk> and <unk> by providing <unk> fire upon Confederate <unk> , <unk> and vessels with relative &lt; unk &gt; to enemy fire .
They were not as heavily armored as the ocean @ - @ going monitors of the Union , but they were <unk> for their intended use .
More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes ( mines ) than by enemy fire , and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore <unk> , not Confederate vessels .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; : First fleet battle = = = The first fleet battle , and the first ocean battle , involving ironclad warships was the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; between the Austrian and Italian navies , the battle <unk> combined fleets of wooden frigates and &lt; unk &gt; and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
The Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships , <unk> <unk> which carried troops <unk> to land on the Adriatic island of &lt; unk &gt; .
Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates , four smaller ironclads , and the newly built &lt; unk &gt; — a double @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ram .
&lt; unk &gt; them , the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates .
The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy , so decided to engage the <unk> at close range and ram them .
The Austrian fleet formed into an &lt; unk &gt; formation with the ironclads in the first line , <unk> at the Italian ironclad squadron .
In the &lt; unk &gt; which followed both sides were <unk> by the lack of damage inflicted by guns , and by the difficulty of &lt; unk &gt; — nonetheless , the effective &lt; unk &gt; attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years .
The superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads , <unk> d &apos; <unk> and <unk> , while the Austrian &lt; unk &gt; screw two @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> <unk> survived close actions with four Italian ironclads .
The battle <unk> the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years , and the victory won by Austria established it as the <unk> naval power in the Adriatic .
The battles of the American Civil War and at &lt; unk &gt; were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed .
In particular , it <unk> a generation of naval officers the <unk> <unk> that &lt; unk &gt; was the best way to <unk> enemy ironclads .
= = <unk> and tactics = = The adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of <unk> of light cannon became <unk> , since their shot would <unk> off an armored hull .
To penetrate armor , increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships ; nevertheless , the view that &lt; unk &gt; was the only way to <unk> an ironclad became widespread .
The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships <unk> many guns broadside , in the manner of a ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line , towards a handful of guns in turrets for all @ - @ round fire .
= = = <unk> <unk> = = = From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval <unk> believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon in naval warfare .
With steam power <unk> ships from the wind , and armor making them &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; , the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow .

From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram .
<unk> who noted the <unk> number of ships that had actually been sunk by &lt; unk &gt; <unk> to be heard .
The <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; had a significant effect on naval tactics .
Since the 17th century the <unk> <unk> of naval warfare had been the line of battle , where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns .
This <unk> was <unk> <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; , and the ram threw fleet tactics into &lt; unk &gt; .
The question of how an ironclad fleet should <unk> in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle , and if it had been , combat might have shown that <unk> could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water .
The ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s , as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo , with less vulnerability to quick @ - @ firing guns .
= = = Development of naval guns = = = The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of <unk> the armor of enemy ships at range ; calibre and weight of guns increased <unk> to achieve greater penetration .
Throughout the ironclad era navies also &lt; unk &gt; with the &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> <unk> smoothbore guns and breech @ - @ loading <unk> muzzle @ - @ loading .
HMS Warrior carried a mixture of 110 @ - @ pounder 7 inch ( 180 mm ) breech @ - @ loading <unk> and more traditional 68 @ - @ pounder smoothbore guns .
Warrior <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the right armament ; the breech @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; she carried , designed by Sir William Armstrong , were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy , but were shortly withdrawn from service .
&lt; unk &gt; @ - @ loading guns seemed to offer important advantages .
A breech @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; could be &lt; unk &gt; without moving the gun , a <unk> process particularly if the gun then needed to be re @ - @ aimed .
The Warrior &apos; s Armstrong guns also had the <unk> of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and , because of their &lt; unk &gt; , more accurate .
<unk> , the design was rejected because of problems which <unk> breech @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; for decades .
The weakness of the breech @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; was the obvious problem of <unk> the breech .
All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of <unk> into gas .
This explosion &lt; unk &gt; the shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but also &lt; unk &gt; great <unk> on the gun @ - @ barrel .
If the breech — which <unk> some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will <unk> through the breech or that the breech will break .
This in turn <unk> the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also <unk> the gun crew .
The Warrior &apos; s Armstrong guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4 @ .
@ 5 in ( <unk> mm ) armor of Gloire , while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew <unk> out of the gun on firing .
<unk> problems were experienced with the breech @ - @ loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies .
These problems influenced the British to <unk> ships with muzzle @ - @ loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s .
After a brief introduction of 100 @ - @ pounder or 9 @ .
@ 5 @ - @ inch ( 240 mm ) smoothbore <unk> <unk> , which weighed 6 @ .
@ 5 tons ( 6 @ .
@ 6 t ) , the Admiralty introduced 7 @ - @ inch ( <unk> mm ) <unk> guns , weighing 7 tons .
These were followed by a series of increasingly &lt; unk &gt; weapons — guns weighing 12 , 25 , 25 , 38 and finally 81 tons , with calibre increasing from 8 @ - @ inch ( <unk> mm ) to 16 @ - @ inch ( <unk> mm ) .
The decision to retain muzzle @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; until the 1880s has been <unk> by historians .
However , at least until the late 1870s , the British muzzle @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and <unk> breech @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; , which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns .
From 1875 onwards , the balance between &lt; unk &gt; and muzzle @ - @ loading changed .
Captain de &lt; unk &gt; invented a method of <unk> <unk> a breech , adopted by the French in <unk> .
Just as &lt; unk &gt; , the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @ - @ loading much more complicated .
With guns of such size there was no prospect of &lt; unk &gt; in the gun for re @ - @ loading , or even re @ - @ loading by hand , and complicated <unk> systems were required for re @ - @ loading the gun outside the turret without <unk> the crew to enemy fire .
In <unk> , the 81 @ - @ <unk> , 16 @ - @ inch ( <unk> mm ) guns of HMS &lt; unk &gt; fired only once every 11 minutes while <unk> <unk> during the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The 100 @ - @ <unk> , 450 mm ( 17 @ .
@ 72 inch ) guns of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; could each fire a round every 15 minutes .
In the Royal Navy , the switch to breech @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; was finally made in <unk> ; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance , <unk> was &lt; unk &gt; by an explosion on board HMS &lt; unk &gt; caused by a gun being double @ - @ loaded , a problem which could only <unk> with a muzzle @ - @ loading gun .
The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far .
The larger the gun , the <unk> it would be to load , the greater the <unk> on the ship &apos; s hull , and the less the stability of the ship .
The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s , with some of the heaviest &lt; unk &gt; of gun ever used at sea .
HMS &lt; unk &gt; carried two 16 @ .
@ 25 @ - @ inch ( &lt; unk &gt; mm ) breech @ - @ loading guns , each weighing 110 tons — no British battleship would ever carry guns as large .
The Italian 450 mm ( 17 @ .
@ 72 inch ) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18 @ .
@ 1 @ - @ inch ( <unk> mm ) armament of the Japanese <unk> class of World War II .
One <unk> which became more <unk> was that even from the original Armstrong models , following the <unk> War , range and hitting power far <unk> simple <unk> , especially at sea where the <unk> roll or pitch of the vessel as &apos; floating weapons @ - @ platform &apos; could &lt; unk &gt; the advantage of &lt; unk &gt; .
American <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> smoothbore <unk> whose round shot could at least &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; along the surface of the water .
&lt; unk &gt; effective combat <unk> , they had learned during the Civil War , were <unk> to those in the Age of &lt; unk &gt; — though a vessel could now be <unk> to pieces in only a few rounds .
<unk> and the general <unk> of battle only added to the problem .
As a result , many naval engagements in the &apos; Age of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; were still fought at <unk> within easy <unk> of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships &apos; guns .
Another method of increasing <unk> was to vary the &lt; unk &gt; fired or the nature of the <unk> .
Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after <unk> ; this meant <unk> had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself <unk> the shell .
The &lt; unk &gt; of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were <unk> to extreme <unk> .
One important step was to press the powder into &lt; unk &gt; , allowing a <unk> , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel .
A further step forward was the introduction of <unk> different <unk> powder which &lt; unk &gt; more slowly again .
It also put less <unk> on the &lt; unk &gt; of the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The development of &lt; unk &gt; powder , based on &lt; unk &gt; or &lt; unk &gt; , by the French <unk> Paul &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> was a further step allowing smaller charges of <unk> with longer barrels .
The guns of the pre @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in ( <unk> mm ) , but <unk> grew in length of barrel , making use of improved &lt; unk &gt; to gain greater muzzle velocity .
The nature of the <unk> also changed during the ironclad period .
Initially , the best armor @ - @ piercing &lt; unk &gt; was a solid cast @ - @ iron shot .
Later , shot of &lt; unk &gt; iron , a <unk> iron <unk> , gave better armor @ - @ piercing qualities .
<unk> the armor @ - @ piercing shell was developed .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; of armament = = = = = = = &lt; unk &gt; ironclads = = = = The first British , French and Russian ironclads , in a <unk> development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line , carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called &quot; broadside ironclads . &quot;
Both Gloire and HMS Warrior were examples of this type .
Because their armor was so heavy , they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck .
A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s , <unk> in Britain and France , but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy , Austria , Russia and the United States .
The advantages of <unk> guns on both <unk> was that the ship could engage more than one &lt; unk &gt; at a time , and the <unk> did not <unk> the field of fire .
&lt; unk &gt; armament also had <unk> , which became more serious as ironclad <unk> developed .
&lt; unk &gt; guns to penetrate ever @ - @ <unk> armor meant that fewer guns could be carried .
Furthermore , the adoption of &lt; unk &gt; as an important <unk> meant the need for ahead and all @ - @ round fire .
These problems led to broadside designs being <unk> by designs that gave greater all @ - @ round fire , which included central @ - @ battery , turret , and barbette designs .
= = = = &lt; unk &gt; , batteries and barbettes = = = = There were two main design &lt; unk &gt; to the broadside .
In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the &apos; box @ - @ battery &apos; or &apos; centre @ - @ battery &apos; .
In the other , the guns could be placed on a <unk> platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or &lt; unk &gt; , a barbette .
The centre @ - @ battery was the <unk> and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method .
&lt; unk &gt; guns amidships meant the ship could be <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; than a broadside type .
The first full @ - @ scale centre @ - @ battery ship was HMS <unk> of <unk> ; the French laid down centre @ - @ battery ironclads in <unk> which were not completed until <unk> .
Centre @ - @ battery ships often , but not always , had a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> some of their guns to fire directly ahead .
The turret was first used in naval combat on the USS &lt; unk &gt; in 1862 , with a type of turret designed by the <unk> engineer John <unk> .
A <unk> turret design was proposed by the British <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; with a prototype of this installed on HMS &lt; unk &gt; in 1861 for <unk> and <unk> purposes .
<unk> &apos; s turret turned on a central <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s turned on a ring of <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s .
The fire arc of a turret would be <unk> limited by masts and <unk> , so they were <unk> to use on the earlier ocean @ - @ going ironclads .
The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy .
<unk> was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately <unk> a ship with very low &lt; unk &gt; .
The weight thus <unk> from having a high broadside above the <unk> was <unk> to actual guns and armour .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; , however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel .
In many <unk> , the &lt; unk &gt; , low @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and the broadside &lt; unk &gt; HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; was all about .
The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes , or &apos; &lt; unk &gt; this circle &apos; , was designed by Captain &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; : HMS Captain , a <unk> low &lt; unk &gt; turret ship which nevertheless carried a full <unk> of sail , and which subsequently <unk> not long after her launch in <unk> .
Her half @ - @ sister HMS <unk> was <unk> to firing from her turrets only on the port and <unk> <unk> .
The third Royal Navy ship to <unk> turrets and masts was HMS &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> , which carried two turrets on either side of the centre @ - @ line , allowing both to fire <unk> , aft and broadside .
A lighter alternative to the turret , particularly popular with the French navy , was the barbette .
These were <unk> armored <unk> which held a gun on a &lt; unk &gt; .
The crew was <unk> from direct fire , but vulnerable to &lt; unk &gt; fire , for instance from shore <unk> .
The barbette was lighter than the turret , <unk> less <unk> and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top @ - @ weight of their ships .
The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s , and with the addition of an armored &apos; gun @ - @ house &apos; , transformed into the turrets of the pre @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; battleships .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; = = = The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons , which helped &lt; unk &gt; the design and tactics of ironclad fleets .
The first torpedoes were <unk> mines , used extensively in the American Civil War .
That conflict also saw the development of the <unk> torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat .
For the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; against ironclads , the threat from the <unk> torpedo was taken <unk> .
The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become &lt; unk &gt; armored <unk> @ - @ torpedo vessels while under construction in <unk> – 5 , but these vessels never saw action .
Another proposal , the <unk> or &apos; Harvey &apos; torpedo , involved an explosive on a line or &lt; unk &gt; ; either to <unk> a ship from &lt; unk &gt; or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less &lt; unk &gt; .
A more practical and influential weapon was the self @ - @ propelled or <unk> torpedo .
&lt; unk &gt; in <unk> and deployed in the 1870s , the <unk> torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS &lt; unk &gt; and the Italian &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
The ironclad &apos; s vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the <unk> of armored warships made by the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; school of naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo .
In practice , however , the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the <unk> mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads .
= = <unk> and construction = = The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls , and protected by wrought iron armor <unk> by thick wooden &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; : iron , wood and steel = = = <unk> iron construction for warships offered advantages for the <unk> of the hull .
However , &lt; unk &gt; iron had many military <unk> , and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years , particularly for long @ - @ range <unk> warships .
Iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the <unk> .
In the <unk> and 1840s , France , Britain and the United States had all <unk> with iron @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; but &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and frigates .
However , the iron @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s , because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot ; iron was more <unk> than wood , and iron <unk> more likely to fall out of shape than wood .
The &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor .
However , iron gave the naval architect many advantages .
Iron allowed larger ships and more <unk> design , for instance the use of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> on the lower <unk> .
Warrior , built of iron , was longer and <unk> than the wooden @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Gloire .
Iron could be produced to order and used immediately , in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of &lt; unk &gt; .
And , given the large <unk> of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron , iron hulls were increasingly cost @ - @ effective .
The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough , and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought .
Wooden hulls continued to be used for long @ - @ range and smaller ironclads , because iron nevertheless had a significant <unk> .
Iron hulls suffered quick &lt; unk &gt; by <unk> life , <unk> the ships down — &lt; unk &gt; for a European &lt; unk &gt; close to dry <unk> , but a difficulty for long @ - @ range ships .
The only solution was to <unk> the iron hull first in wood and then in <unk> , a <unk> and <unk> process which made wooden construction remain attractive .
Iron and wood were to some extent <unk> : the Japanese &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ordered in 1875 were sister @ - @ ships , but one was built of iron and the other of <unk> construction .
After <unk> , steel started to be introduced as a material for construction .
<unk> to iron , steel allows for greater <unk> strength for a lower weight .
The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet , starting with the &lt; unk &gt; , laid down in <unk> and launched in <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate , and part of her <unk> hull was iron rather than steel .
Even though Britain led the world in steel production , the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships .
The &lt; unk &gt; process for steel manufacture produced too many <unk> for large @ - @ scale use on ships .
French <unk> used the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ Martin process to produce <unk> steel , but British <unk> &lt; unk &gt; behind .
The first all @ - @ steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the <unk> vessels &lt; unk &gt; and Mercury , laid down in 1875 and <unk> .
= = = <unk> and protection <unk> = = = Iron @ - @ built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme .
HMS Warrior was protected by 4 @ .
@ 5 in ( 114 mm ) of wrought iron <unk> by 15 in ( <unk> mm ) of &lt; unk &gt; , the strongest <unk> wood .
The wood played two roles , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and also <unk> the <unk> of a hit damaging the structure of the ship .
Later , wood and iron were combined in &apos; <unk> &apos; armor , for instance in HMS &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> was also an obvious material for armor .
It was tested in the 1860s , but the steel of the time was too <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; when struck by shells .
<unk> became practical to use when a way was found to <unk> steel onto wrought iron plates , giving a form of compound armor .
This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s , first for turret armor ( starting with HMS &lt; unk &gt; ) and then for all armor ( starting with HMS &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> ) .
The French and German navies adopted the <unk> almost immediately , with <unk> being given for the use of the &apos; Wilson System &apos; of producing <unk> armor .
The first ironclads to have all @ - @ steel armor were the Italian &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Though the ships were laid down in <unk> their armor was not purchased from France until <unk> .
The French navy decided in <unk> to adopt compound armor for its fleet , but found it limited in supply , so from <unk> the French navy was using steel armor .
Britain stuck to compound armor until <unk> .
The <unk> ironclad armor was case <unk> <unk> @ - @ steel .
In <unk> , the U.S. Navy tested steel armor <unk> by the Harvey process and found it superior to compound armor .
For several years &apos; Harvey steel &apos; was the state of the art , produced in the U.S. , France , Germany , Britain , Austria and Italy .
In <unk> , the German <unk> &lt; unk &gt; developed gas &lt; unk &gt; , which further <unk> steel armor .
The German <unk> Friedrich III , laid down in <unk> , was the first ship to <unk> from the new &apos; &lt; unk &gt; armor &apos; and the new armor was quickly adopted ; the Royal Navy using it from HMS <unk> , laid down in <unk> .
By <unk> almost all new battleships used &lt; unk &gt; armor , though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade .
The equivalent <unk> of the different armor plates was as follows : 15 in ( <unk> mm ) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in ( <unk> mm ) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor , and to 7 @ .
@ 75 in ( <unk> mm ) of Harvey armor or 5 @ .
@ 75 in ( <unk> mm ) of &lt; unk &gt; armor .
&lt; unk &gt; construction also &lt; unk &gt; the later debate in battleship design between &lt; unk &gt; and &apos; all @ - @ or @ - @ nothing &apos; armour design .
Warrior was only semi @ - @ armoured , and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern .
As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns , the area of the ship which could be fully protected <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s armor protection was largely limited to the central <unk> amidships , <unk> boilers and engines , turrets and magazines , and little else .
An <unk> arrangement of &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ filled <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> was intended to keep her stable and <unk> in the event of heavy damage to her <unk> @ - @ armored sections .
= = &lt; unk &gt; : steam and sail = = The first ocean @ - @ going ironclads carried masts and <unk> like their wooden <unk> , and these features were only gradually abandoned .
Early steam engines were <unk> ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry &quot; 5 to 9 days coal &quot; , and the situation was similar with the early ironclads .
Warrior also <unk> two design features which aided <unk> propulsion ; she had <unk> <unk> to reduce <unk> while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low &lt; unk &gt; ) , and a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> which could be folded down to the deck level .
<unk> designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the &lt; unk &gt; , or USS &lt; unk &gt; and her sisters , &lt; unk &gt; with masts from the beginning .
The British HMS &lt; unk &gt; , started in <unk> , was the first large , ocean @ - @ going ironclad to &lt; unk &gt; with masts .
Her principal role was for combat in the English <unk> and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little <unk> on the other side of the ocean .
The &lt; unk &gt; and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule .
Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on short @ - @ range operations in the Adriatic , built consistently &lt; unk &gt; ironclads .
During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @ - @ expansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models .
The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double @ - @ expansion engine in <unk> , and by 1875 they were widespread .
However , this development alone was not enough to <unk> the end of the <unk> .
<unk> this was due to a <unk> desire to retain <unk> , or was a <unk> response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate .
A steam @ - @ only fleet would require a network of <unk> stations worldwide , which would need to be <unk> at great <unk> to stop them falling into enemy hands .
Just as significantly , because of &lt; unk &gt; problems with the <unk> of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the performance of double @ - @ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory .
During the 1870s the <unk> grew between &apos; first @ - @ class ironclads &apos; or &apos; battleships &apos; on the one hand , and &apos; <unk> ironclads &apos; designed for long @ - @ range work on the other .
The demands on first @ - @ class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing <unk> , which reduced speed under sail ; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing <unk> increasingly &lt; unk &gt; .
HMS &lt; unk &gt; , launched in <unk> but not commissioned until <unk> , was the last British battleship to carry masts , and these were widely seen as a <unk> .
The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing <unk> on ironclad battleships .
&lt; unk &gt; persisted on &apos; <unk> ironclads &apos; for much longer .
During the 1860s , the French navy had produced the <unk> and La &lt; unk &gt; <unk> as small , long @ - @ range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with ships like HMS &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> .

Even the later HMS <unk> , often described as the first British armored cruiser , would have been too slow to &lt; unk &gt; General @ - @ Admiral .
While <unk> was the last British ship with a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; speed under steam in <unk> .
It took until <unk> for the Royal Navy to lay down a long @ - @ range armored warship capable of <unk> enemy commerce <unk> , HMS <unk> , which was completed in <unk> .
While sailing <unk> were <unk> for all purposes by the end of the 1880s , <unk> ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century .
The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple @ - @ expansion steam engine , a further <unk> which was first adopted in HMS <unk> <unk> , laid down in <unk> and commissioned in <unk> .
Many ships also used a forced <unk> to get additional power from their engines , and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam <unk> in the mid @ - @ <unk> ( decade ) .
= = <unk> = = While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide , there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads .
Most European nations settled differences on land , and the Royal Navy <unk> to maintain a <unk> <unk> with at least France , while providing suitable protection to Britain &apos; s commerce and colonial <unk> worldwide .

The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships , and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles .
In the age of sail , the British strategy for war <unk> on the Royal Navy <unk> a <unk> of the ports of the enemy .
Because of the limited <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , this was no longer possible , so the British at times considered the risk @ - @ <unk> plan of <unk> an enemy fleet in <unk> as soon as war broke out .
To this end , the Royal Navy developed a series of &apos; coast @ - @ defence battleships &apos; , starting with the &lt; unk &gt; class .
These &apos; &lt; unk &gt; monitors &apos; were <unk> different from the other high @ - @ seas ironclads of the period and were an important <unk> of the modern battleship .
As long @ - @ range monitors they could reach <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , for example .
However , they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and <unk> ( and enemy monitors ) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War .
The British prepared for an <unk> mortar bombardment of &lt; unk &gt; by the close of the <unk> War , but never considered running the <unk> @ - @ <unk> , shallow @ - @ water <unk> straight to St. <unk> with ironclads .
Likewise , monitors proved &lt; unk &gt; unable to &apos; <unk> &apos; enemy fortifications single @ - @ handed during the American conflict , though their low @ - @ profile and heavy armour protection made them <unk> for running &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; and <unk> , however , <unk> these advantages — a problem the British Admiralty frequently <unk> but never <unk> throughout the period .
The British never laid down enough &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ class &apos; battleships &apos; to <unk> <unk> <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; or even New York City with gunfire .
Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many <unk> superior to its potential rivals , by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act , which <unk> the idea of a &apos; two @ - @ power standard &apos; , that Britain should <unk> as many ships as the next two navies combined .
This standard <unk> <unk> <unk> in the 1880s and 1890s .
British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period .
The Royal Navy &apos; s ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one @ - @ <unk> engagements like the bombardment of <unk> in <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; British <unk> against <unk> &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Egyptian revolt , a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of <unk> .
A mixture of centre @ - @ battery and turret ships <unk> Egyptian positions for most of a day , forcing the <unk> to retreat ; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first , but inflicted little damage , killing only five British sailors .

The French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British , but were consistently out @ - @ built by the British .
Despite taking the lead with a number of <unk> like breech @ - @ loading weapons and steel construction , the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy .
In the 1870s , the construction of ironclads <unk> for a while in France as the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; school of naval thought took <unk> , suggesting that torpedo boats and &lt; unk &gt; cruisers would be the future of warships .
Like the British , the French navy saw little action with its ironclads ; the French <unk> of Germany in the <unk> @ - @ <unk> War was <unk> , as the war was settled entirely on land .
Russia built a number of ironclads , generally copies of British or French designs .

The Russian Navy <unk> the wide @ - @ scale use of torpedo boats during the <unk> @ - @ <unk> War of <unk> – <unk> , mainly out of <unk> because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the <unk> navy .
Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships , but the ships were <unk> by <unk> crews and politically appointed leadership , which enhanced their defeat in the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; on 27 May <unk> .
The U.S. Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty monitor @ - @ type coastal ironclads ; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve , leaving the USA virtually without an ironclad fleet .
Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s .
The <unk> of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from <unk> power overseas , and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers .
The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the Great White Fleet , and it was the modern pre @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish – American War of <unk> .
This started a new era of naval warfare .
&lt; unk &gt; were widely used in South America .
Both sides used ironclads in the &lt; unk &gt; Islands War between Spain and the combined forces of <unk> and Chile in the early 1860s .
The powerful Spanish &lt; unk &gt; participated in the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; but was unable to <unk> significant damage to the &lt; unk &gt; defences .

In the War of the Pacific in <unk> , both <unk> and Chile had ironclad warships , including some of those used a few years previously against Spain .
While the &lt; unk &gt; ran <unk> early on , the <unk> ironclad &apos; &lt; unk &gt; made a great impact against <unk> shipping , <unk> <unk> ground invasion by six months .
She was eventually caught by two more modern <unk> centre @ - @ battery ironclads , the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; Point .
&lt; unk &gt; were also used from the <unk> of the Imperial Japanese Navy .
The &lt; unk &gt; ( Japanese : &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , later renamed &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &quot; East &quot; ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of &lt; unk &gt; Bay in May <unk> , which marked the end of the &lt; unk &gt; War , and the complete establishment of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European <unk> , first ironclads and later armored cruisers .
These ships engaged the Chinese &lt; unk &gt; fleet which was superior on paper at least at the Battle of the &lt; unk &gt; River .
&lt; unk &gt; to superior short @ - @ range <unk> , the Japanese fleet came off better , sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four .

&lt; unk &gt; continued to be used in World War I.
Towards the end of the 19th century , the <unk> &apos; battleship &apos; and &apos; armored cruiser &apos; came to replace the term &apos; ironclad &apos; .
The <unk> of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a <unk> on the design of battleships , producing the type known as the pre @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; .
These ships are sometimes covered in <unk> of the ironclad warship .
The next evolution of battleship design , the <unk> , is never referred to as an &apos; ironclad &apos; .
Most of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into the <unk> ( decade ) .
For instance , a handful of US navy monitors laid down in the 1870s saw active service in World War I. Pre @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; battleships and cruisers of the 1890s saw widespread action in World War I and in some cases through to World War II .

= Little &lt; unk &gt; ( poem ) = Little &lt; unk &gt; is the fourth and final poem of T. S. Eliot &apos; s Four &lt; unk &gt; , a series of poems that discuss time , perspective , humanity , and <unk> .
It was first published in September 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the air @ - @ raids on Great Britain during World War II and Eliot &apos; s <unk> health .
The title refers to a small <unk> community in &lt; unk &gt; , established by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War .
The poem uses the combined image of fire and &lt; unk &gt; fire to <unk> the need for <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; .
According to the poet , humanity &apos; s <unk> understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare , but this can be <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> of the past .
Within the poem , the <unk> meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures .
Little &lt; unk &gt; <unk> on the <unk> of past , present , and future , and claims that understanding this <unk> is necessary for <unk> .
= = Background = = Following the <unk> of the third Four &lt; unk &gt; poem , The <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Eliot &apos; s health declined and he stayed in &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , <unk> while he recovered .
During this time , Eliot started writing Little &lt; unk &gt; .
The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was <unk> with it .
He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own <unk> to write , and that , <unk> by air raids on London , he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly .
After the first draft was written , he set the poem aside , and he left in September to <unk> throughout Great Britain .
After months of not working on the poem , Eliot began to feel <unk> to finish it ; it was not until August 1942 , however , that he started working on it again .
In total , there were five <unk> .
The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English <unk> .
Little &lt; unk &gt; was intended to <unk> the Four &lt; unk &gt; series , &lt; unk &gt; Eliot &apos; s views expressed in this series of poems .
Little &lt; unk &gt; was the home of an <unk> community established in &lt; unk &gt; by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; household lived a Christian life according to High Church principles and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The religious community was dispersed during the English Civil War between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; but <unk> , ending with the death of John &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; .
Eliot had visited the site in May <unk> .
Unlike the other locations mentioned in the <unk> of the Four &lt; unk &gt; poems , Eliot had no direct connection to the original Christian community .
As such , the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community .
= = <unk> = = Critics <unk> Little &lt; unk &gt; as a poem of fire with an emphasis on &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; fire .
The beginning of the poem <unk> time and winter , with attention paid to the arrival of summer .
The images of snow , which <unk> <unk> for a <unk> life , transition into an analysis of the four <unk> elements of fire , <unk> , air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four .
Following this is a discussion on death and destruction , things &lt; unk &gt; , and <unk> for past events .
While using Dante &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; style , the poem continues by describing the Battle of Britain .
The image of warfare &lt; unk &gt; with the depiction of &lt; unk &gt; , and the Holy <unk> is <unk> with the air @ - @ raids on London .
In the second section , a ghost , representing the poets of the past stuck between <unk> , begins talking to the <unk> of the poem .
The ghost <unk> change , art in general , and how <unk> is <unk> .
The only way to <unk> the <unk> condition of humanity , according to the ghost , is to experience &lt; unk &gt; through fire .
The fire is described in a manner similar to <unk> of <unk> &apos; s writing about God &apos; s love and discussed in relationship to the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , a <unk> that <unk> its <unk> .
Little &lt; unk &gt; continues by describing the &lt; unk &gt; of the present and how history <unk> in a pattern .
The poem concludes by explaining how <unk> is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be <unk> , and that <unk> should be the goal of <unk> .
= = <unk> = = In terms of <unk> , Eliot believed that suffering was needed for all of society before new life could begin .
The original Little &lt; unk &gt; community was built for living on <unk> lines , but the community was damaged and dispersed by <unk> forces during the English Civil War in <unk> .
The church , the centre of the community , was restored in <unk> and again in <unk> .
The image of religious <unk> is combined with the image of the London air @ - @ raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world .
This compound image is used to discuss the connection of <unk> places with the Holy <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> with the dead , and the <unk> of history .
The theme is also <unk> to Eliot &apos; s own poems ; the image of the rose garden at the end Little &lt; unk &gt; is the image that begins &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and the journey is made circular .
Also , the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family &lt; unk &gt; .
Like the other poems making up the Four &lt; unk &gt; , Little &lt; unk &gt; <unk> with the past , present , and future , and humanity &apos; s place within them as each generation is <unk> <unk> .
In the second section , there is a ghost who is the <unk> of various poets , including Dante , <unk> , Yeats , and others .
When the ghost <unk> the poet , the <unk> states &quot; <unk> <unk> yet being someone other &quot; .
This suggests that the different times <unk> at the same time that the different <unk> begin to <unk> , allowing a communication and connection with the dead .
Later , in the fourth section , humanity is given a choice between the Holy <unk> or the bombing of London ; redemption or destruction .
God &apos; s love allows <unk> to be &lt; unk &gt; and escape the living <unk> through &lt; unk &gt; by fire .
The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet .
He <unk> his work in language with working on the soul or working on society .
The ghost , a combination of many literary figures , was originally addressed in the poem as &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; before being revised as an <unk> &quot; you &quot; . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; was Dante &apos; s way of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , a former <unk> whom he meets in Hell to which he has been <unk> for &lt; unk &gt; .
Eliot , in a letter to John &lt; unk &gt; dated 27 August 1942 , explained why he changed the <unk> : I think you will <unk> that it was necessary to get <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; for two reasons .
The first is that the <unk> figure has now become somewhat more <unk> and will no <unk> be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so <unk> as that .
However , I do not <unk> to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or <unk> else into Hell and I do not want to &lt; unk &gt; to him the particular vice which took &lt; unk &gt; there .
&lt; unk &gt; , although the reference to that &lt; unk &gt; is intended to be <unk> , I <unk> the effect of the whole to be &lt; unk &gt; which is more appropriate .
That brings us to the reference to <unk> in fire which you will <unk> at the end of &lt; unk &gt; 26 where the poets are found .
The theme of <unk> through <unk> is connected to the depiction of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , a poet that influenced Dante , seeking such a state in &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
However , the depiction of <unk> was transformed into an image of <unk> , an act that appears throughout Yeats &apos; s poetry , within &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The critic Dominic &lt; unk &gt; suggests that , in <unk> the image of <unk> with &lt; unk &gt; , Eliot &lt; unk &gt; Dante &apos; s and Yeats &apos; s poetic themes .
= = Reception = = Critics such as <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; describe mixed <unk> about the &lt; unk &gt; of the poem .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> the <unk> nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to <unk> than &lt; unk &gt; while <unk> his <unk> of many of the <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; also mentioned the <unk> images and his <unk> for many of the lines in Little &lt; unk &gt; .
F. <unk>
&lt; unk &gt; believed that the fourth section of the poem costs &quot; Eliot more trouble and &lt; unk &gt; than any passage of the same length he ever wrote , and is his greatest <unk> in the Four &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
E. M. <unk> did not like Eliot &apos; s emphasis on pain and responded to the poem : &quot; Of course there &apos; s pain on and off through each individual &apos; s life ... You can &apos; t &lt; unk &gt; it and so on .
But why should it be <unk> by the <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; by the <unk> until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; ?
It is here that Eliot becomes <unk> as a <unk> . &quot;
Writing in 2003 , Roger &lt; unk &gt; wrote that in &quot; Little &lt; unk &gt; &quot; Eliot achieved &quot; that for which he &lt; unk &gt; Dante — namely , a poetry of belief , in which belief and words are one , and in which the thought cannot be <unk> free from the controlled and beautiful language &quot; .

= = Background and publication = = George Steiner , literary critic for The New Yorker and The New York Times , had written about the Holocaust in some of his previous books , including &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( 1964 ) , <unk> and <unk> ( 1967 ) and In &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> ( 1971 ) .
Many of the ideas Steiner <unk> in The Portage to San &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; were reworked from these earlier works .
Steiner told New York Times editor D. <unk> R. &lt; unk &gt; that this book <unk> out of his <unk> work on language . &quot;
Central to everything I <unk> and believe and have written is my &lt; unk &gt; ... that you can use human speech both to &lt; unk &gt; , to love , to build , to <unk> and also to <unk> , to <unk> , to destroy and to &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
<unk> on the controversy the book generated , Steiner <unk> to literary <unk> and critic <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ( author of <unk> Hitler ) that he too was disturbed by it , adding that his <unk> Hitler had <unk> the better of him , &quot; &lt; unk &gt; or &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ like &quot; .
He said that it felt like the book &quot; wrote me &quot; .
Steiner also pointed out that the <unk> is not only about his <unk> on the Holocaust , but also about the <unk> events that took place in countries like <unk> , Vietnam , El <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; : &quot; My feeling is that one has to &lt; unk &gt; with the &lt; unk &gt; if one can . &quot;
Steiner wrote The Portage to San &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; in 1975 and 1976 in <unk> , <unk> , and the 120 @ - @ <unk> work originally appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of the United States literary magazine , The Kenyon <unk> .
It also appeared in the Spring 1980 issue of &lt; unk &gt; , the British literary magazine .
Its first publication in book form , with minor <unk> by Steiner , was in May 1981 by &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; in the United Kingdom — and as requested by Steiner , it was a <unk> original .
The first United States edition was published in <unk> in April 1982 by Simon &amp; <unk> .
= = <unk> = = The Portage to San &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; was adapted for the theatre in 1982 by British <unk> Christopher Hampton .
It was staged in April 1982 at London &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; Theatre under the direction of John <unk> with <unk> &lt; unk &gt; playing the part of Adolf Hitler .
&lt; unk &gt; won the 1982 Evening Standard Theatre Award for best actor for this performance .
In 1983 the production moved to the United States where it played at the <unk> <unk> Company in <unk> , Connecticut , directed by Mark &lt; unk &gt; and starring John &lt; unk &gt; as Hitler .
This book is the only work of <unk> by Steiner to have been adapted for the stage .
= = Reception = = <unk> to The Portage to San &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; was mixed .
Anthony &lt; unk &gt; in The Observer called it &quot; <unk> &quot; , Christopher <unk> of The Daily Telegraph described it as a &quot; powerful piece &quot; , and English author A. S. &lt; unk &gt; said it was a &quot; <unk> &quot; .
In <unk> Hitler , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; called The Portage &quot; A &lt; unk &gt; story &quot; , referring to Steiner &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; Hitler has having taken on a life of its own .
Writing in Time magazine , <unk> Friedrich described the book &quot; a &lt; unk &gt; fantasy of remarkable intensity &quot; , adding that by not &lt; unk &gt; Hitler &apos; s speech , Steiner &lt; unk &gt; from the &lt; unk &gt; of traditional Holocaust literature and ends the book &quot; on a note of <unk> ambiguity &quot; .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; of The New York Times was more critical of the book , calling it &quot; a &lt; unk &gt; and badly executed novel , a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> from the serious business of thinking through the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of the Nazi era . &quot;
He described it as &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; that is &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &#91; d &#93; &quot; by too much &quot; fine writing &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ) .
He also <unk> that the characters are <unk> , and while they each have <unk> histories , they are only &quot; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &quot; that do not separate them from one another .
Finally &lt; unk &gt; noted that because almost all the points of Hitler &apos; s speech are drawn from some of Steiner &apos; s earlier works , he &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> for Hitler by making him old and <unk> yet also &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> — at once &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> . &quot;
In another review in The New York Times John <unk> wrote that while the book has its strong points , &quot; some <unk> , a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , <unk> of character and a South American <unk> @ - @ life that &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , its <unk> are that &quot; the characters are really ideas , ... the <unk> <unk> and there are too many <unk> of better books by &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
But <unk> &apos; s <unk> criticism of the book was Hitler &apos; s speech , which he called &quot; <unk> &quot; , and Steiner &apos; s decision to end the book at that point , which <unk> said &quot; not only <unk> the power of art to <unk> and <unk> , but ... makes me <unk> to my <unk> . &quot;
Writing in the American literary magazine &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> H. &lt; unk &gt; called The Portage a &quot; <unk> work &quot; that &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
He was struck by the book &apos; s <unk> between the landscape of <unk> and jungle , and the &quot; landscape of speech &quot; — the former being &quot; <unk> registered &quot; with its &quot; <unk> feeling of &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , and the latter , &quot; even more dramatic &quot; in the way it <unk> &quot; the dark <unk> of words &quot; and how its use and <unk> reveals the true nature of a person .
He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and his role as representative of the Jewish <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; noted that while Holocaust literature often either &lt; unk &gt; to &quot; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> &quot; , or <unk> to &quot; a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> <unk> &quot; , Steiner &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; &quot; &lt; unk &gt; between these two extremes , ... simultaneously records and &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; yet <unk> an <unk> <unk> &quot; .
What did concern the reviewer , however , was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works , that he had put them &quot; virtually &lt; unk &gt; &quot; into Hitler &apos; s mouth , creating the <unk> that &quot; Steiner &apos; s understanding of Hitler were identical with the latter &apos; s self @ - @ understanding &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; also <unk> why the book had to end with Hitler &apos; s speech .
He said that Steiner &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; Hitler plays &quot; the <unk> &apos; s game of language <unk> &quot; , making &quot; <unk> &#91; sound &#93; like music &quot; , something the real Hitler had &lt; unk &gt; .
By <unk> at this point , &lt; unk &gt; felt that Steiner &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &#91; s &#93; , &lt; unk &gt; , to the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> &quot; , which &lt; unk &gt; his own &quot; high <unk> of moral intelligence &quot; .
But overall &lt; unk &gt; said The Portage &quot; must be <unk> among the most <unk> attempts to portray the presence and meaning of Hitler &quot; , forcing us to <unk> him &quot; in a way <unk> seen before in <unk> &quot; .
The Portage to San &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; was a &lt; unk &gt; in the 1983 &lt; unk &gt; / <unk> Award for <unk> .
= = <unk> = = The book generated considerable controversy because of its apparent &quot; <unk> for Hitler &quot; .
The controversy grew further when the <unk> stage <unk> ( &quot; too <unk> &quot; , according to Steiner ) was performed in the United Kingdom and the United States .
Hitler &apos; s speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics .
Steiner not only <unk> Hitler <unk> his past , he allows him the ( almost ) last word before the outside world <unk> .
The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more <unk> .
One critic , while <unk> that Steiner always saw Hitler as &quot; the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> &quot; , felt that there was no clear <unk> in the book between Steiner &apos; s own views and those of his <unk> Hitler , even going so far as to <unk> Steiner , who <unk> Jewish <unk> and is a critic of Israel &apos; s treatment of the <unk> , of anti @ - @ <unk> .
In contrast , a Time magazine article at the time felt that Steiner &apos; s intention for the Hitler speech was to use it to <unk> his previously stated belief &quot; that Hitler <unk> language as an almost <unk> force &quot; , <unk> attention to Nazi <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s warning from the book <unk> Hitler : &quot; There <unk> come a man who ... will know the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> it to others .
He will know the sounds of <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; and make them seem music . &quot;
Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler &apos; s speech in this book is &lt; unk &gt; by saying that it had been done before : for example <unk> &apos; s speech in <unk> &apos; s <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , and The Grand &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s speech in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s The <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ( <unk> ) .
He also <unk> the <unk> that Hitler &apos; s speech is <unk> out earlier in the book by &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s long <unk> on the &lt; unk &gt; of the Holocaust .
Finally , Steiner said that his Hitler ( A. H. ) is &quot; a &lt; unk &gt; figure &quot; , and that it is not he who has the last word , but &lt; unk &gt; , the Indian &lt; unk &gt; , who <unk> &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; is also the <unk> word used to indicate that &quot; there are issues here beyond our <unk> to <unk> or <unk> . &quot;
= &lt; unk &gt; = &lt; unk &gt; ( from Greek &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; , &quot; to cut &quot; ) and &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; , &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; ) ) is a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> small to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; — often considered primitive amphibians — that flourished worldwide during the &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; periods .
A few species continued into the <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; have been found on every continent .
During about <unk> million years of <unk> history , they adapted to a wide range of <unk> , including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal <unk> environments .
Their life history is well <unk> , with fossils known from the &lt; unk &gt; stage , &lt; unk &gt; , and <unk> .
Most &lt; unk &gt; were &lt; unk &gt; , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to <unk> .
These &lt; unk &gt; were some of the first <unk> fully adapted to life on land .
Although &lt; unk &gt; are considered amphibians , many had characteristics , such as scales , claws , and armour @ - @ like <unk> plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians .
&lt; unk &gt; have been known since the early 19th century , and were initially thought to be reptiles .
They were described at various times as &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; , although these names are now rarely used .
<unk> now grouped in &lt; unk &gt; were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century , when they were found to <unk> to a distinct <unk> based on the structure of their vertebrae .
&lt; unk &gt; means &quot; cut vertebrae &quot; , as each &lt; unk &gt; is divided into several parts .
<unk> <unk> over whether &lt; unk &gt; were ancestral to modern amphibians ( frogs , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; ) , or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants .
<unk> <unk> have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of &lt; unk &gt; , another group of early &lt; unk &gt; called &lt; unk &gt; , or even as descendants of both groups ( with &lt; unk &gt; <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; and frogs and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; ) .
<unk> studies place a family of &lt; unk &gt; called the &lt; unk &gt; as the closest relatives of modern amphibians .
&lt; unk &gt; in teeth , skulls , and hearing structures link the two groups .
= = <unk> = = Many &lt; unk &gt; are much larger than living amphibians , and <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> are smaller and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Most have broad , flat heads that are either <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) or <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
The skulls are rounded or <unk> in shape when viewed from above , and are usually covered in <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of bones may have supported blood vessels , which could transfer carbon <unk> to the bones to <unk> <unk> build up in the blood ( early &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; would have had difficulty &lt; unk &gt; carbon <unk> from their bodies while on land , and these <unk> bones may have been an early solution to the problem ) .
Many &lt; unk &gt; also have <unk> @ - @ like <unk> in their skulls called <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; , which usually run around the <unk> and eye &lt; unk &gt; , are part of a <unk> line system used to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in water .
As &lt; unk &gt; animals , most &lt; unk &gt; have small limbs with four <unk> on each front foot and five on each <unk> foot .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; have larger , <unk> limbs , and some even have claws .
One unusual terrestrial &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , has relatively long limbs for its body , and probably lived as an active runner able to <unk> prey .
&lt; unk &gt; of most of the bones of &lt; unk &gt; are also seen in other early &lt; unk &gt; , aside from a few bones in the skull , such as &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; , that have developed in some &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Most &lt; unk &gt; have &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in the backs of their skulls , rounded <unk> of bone <unk> from the rest of the skull by &lt; unk &gt; called &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ; in some &lt; unk &gt; , such as &lt; unk &gt; , they are pointed and very prominent .
Among the most <unk> features of &lt; unk &gt; are the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , two large <unk> in the back of the <unk> .
Another pair of <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , are present in front of these &lt; unk &gt; , and connect the <unk> passage with the mouth .
&lt; unk &gt; often have teeth on their &lt; unk &gt; , as well as in their <unk> .
Some of these teeth are so large , they are referred to as &lt; unk &gt; .
In some &lt; unk &gt; , such as &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; in the lower jaw &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> and emerge through <unk> in the top of the skull .
<unk> little is known of the <unk> <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; .
A block of <unk> , described in 2007 from the Early &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of <unk> , included <unk> of the bodies of three &lt; unk &gt; .
These <unk> show , when alive , they had <unk> skin , <unk> limbs with &lt; unk &gt; feet , and a ridge of skin on their &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; to small &lt; unk &gt; have also been found in &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; rocks .
The &lt; unk &gt; , called &lt; unk &gt; , are usually found in <unk> <unk> around <unk> environments , suggesting the animals had some <unk> to the water .
Unlike modern amphibians , many &lt; unk &gt; are covered in small , closely <unk> scales .
The &lt; unk &gt; of most &lt; unk &gt; are covered in rows of large <unk> plates .
During early stages of development , they first have only small , rounded scales .
&lt; unk &gt; show , as the animals grew , the scales on the &lt; unk &gt; of their bodies developed into large , wide <unk> plates .
The plates <unk> each other in a way that allows a wide range of <unk> .
Later &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , such as &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , have no evidence of scales .
They may have lost scales to make movement <unk> under water or to allow &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the <unk> of oxygen through the skin .
Several groups of &lt; unk &gt; have large <unk> plates on their backs .
One &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , has armour @ - @ like plating that covers both its back and <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; also has extensive plating on its back .
Most members of the family &lt; unk &gt; also have armor , although it only covers the <unk> of the back with two narrow rows of plates .
Other &lt; unk &gt; , such as &lt; unk &gt; , have been found with small , disc @ - @ like <unk> &lt; unk &gt; that were in life probably <unk> in the skin .
All of these &lt; unk &gt; were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle .
<unk> may have offered protection from <unk> in the case of &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; may have provided stability for the <unk> , as they would have limited <unk> and may have been connected by strong <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; such as &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long <unk> <unk> on top of their vertebrae that would have <unk> the <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; are also seen in &lt; unk &gt; , but unlike &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; , these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic .
&lt; unk &gt; may have <unk> their armor from a terrestrial <unk> , as both &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; have been considered close relatives of the group .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; vertebrae are divided into several <unk> .
In living &lt; unk &gt; , the main body of the &lt; unk &gt; is a single piece of bone called the &lt; unk &gt; , but in &lt; unk &gt; , this region was divided into a &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
Two types of vertebrae are recognized in &lt; unk &gt; : &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; vertebrae .
In &lt; unk &gt; vertebrae , the &lt; unk &gt; are large and <unk> @ - @ shaped , and the &lt; unk &gt; are relatively small blocks that fit between them .
Both elements support a <unk> @ - @ like <unk> <unk> , and well @ - @ developed &lt; unk &gt; <unk> called &lt; unk &gt; strengthen the connections between vertebrae .
The strong <unk> and strong limbs of many &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; allowed them to be partially , and in some cases fully , terrestrial .
In &lt; unk &gt; vertebrae , the &lt; unk &gt; have been lost entirely , with the &lt; unk &gt; enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae .
This <unk> type of <unk> indicates the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; spent more time in water .
= = History of study = = &lt; unk &gt; was named by German &lt; unk &gt; Karl Alfred von &lt; unk &gt; in his second edition of &lt; unk &gt; der &lt; unk &gt; , published in <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; remains were known since the early part of the 19th century , however .
The earliest described &lt; unk &gt; was &lt; unk &gt; , named by <unk> Friedrich &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; named &lt; unk &gt; from a single tooth , and considered it a <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; means &quot; <unk> tooth <unk> &quot; after the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ like shape of the tip of the tooth .
The naming of these first specimens was <unk> , however .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; named the animal &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> .
In <unk> , English &lt; unk &gt; Richard Owen referred to the genus as &lt; unk &gt; to describe its highly folded or &lt; unk &gt; teeth .
Owen thought the name &lt; unk &gt; &quot; <unk> not to be retained , because it <unk> &lt; unk &gt; the idea of the <unk> genus &lt; unk &gt; , or else a &lt; unk &gt; form of the tooth ... and because the second element of the word , &lt; unk &gt; , indicates a false <unk> , the remains <unk> , not to the &lt; unk &gt; , but to the &lt; unk &gt; order of &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
Owen recognized the animal was not a &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; <unk> , yet he also referred &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; to the genus .
Although the two genera both have similarly sized <unk> teeth , &lt; unk &gt; was later found to be a <unk> @ - @ like <unk> .
<unk> material , including skulls , <unk> placed &lt; unk &gt; as an amphibian .
&lt; unk &gt; also named &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> , <unk> it on <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , or back portion of the skull .
In <unk> , he described a complete skull of S. &lt; unk &gt; that had the same teeth as his &lt; unk &gt; , making it the first known complete skull of a &lt; unk &gt; .
Because &lt; unk &gt; was named first , it has <unk> over the other names as a senior &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; is still used as the name of an <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; and other similar animals were referred to as &lt; unk &gt; , named like &lt; unk &gt; for teeth that were highly folded in cross section .
Owen &apos; s &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; was later found at <unk> &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; , England by paleontologist William <unk> .
Other specimens were found in the red <unk> of <unk> .
As more fossils were <unk> in England , Owen depicted these &lt; unk &gt; as the &quot; highest &quot; form of &lt; unk &gt; and compared them to &lt; unk &gt; , which he considered the highest form of reptiles .
He also noted the large &lt; unk &gt; of the &lt; unk &gt; ( a unit of rocks that <unk> to the Late &lt; unk &gt; ) were younger than more advanced reptiles in the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , which are Late &lt; unk &gt; in age .
Owen used these fossils to counter the <unk> that reptiles evolved from a &lt; unk &gt; progression from early amphibians ( what he called &quot; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; ) .
In addition to &lt; unk &gt; , some of the earliest named genera included &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; in 1859 .
&lt; unk &gt; is now placed as an early &lt; unk &gt; outside &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; is now considered a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Later in the 19th century , &lt; unk &gt; were classified as various members of &lt; unk &gt; , a name <unk> by American paleontologist Edward &lt; unk &gt; Cope in <unk> .
Cope placed &lt; unk &gt; in the class &lt; unk &gt; , the name then used for &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; means &quot; roof @ - @ headed &quot; in Greek , a reference to the wide , flat heads of &lt; unk &gt; and other early &lt; unk &gt; .
During this time , &lt; unk &gt; considered &lt; unk &gt; to be amphibians because they possessed three main features : <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ; ribs that do not connect at the <unk> of the <unk> cage ; and deep <unk> in the skull that were interpreted as space for &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Several &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; were recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
<unk> now regarded as &lt; unk &gt; were primarily &lt; unk &gt; , but some were classified in the &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; were small @ - @ <unk> and had simple <unk> teeth , while &lt; unk &gt; were larger and had complex , folded &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> in their teeth .
&lt; unk &gt; included only a few forms , such as &lt; unk &gt; from Europe and &lt; unk &gt; from North America , that had poorly developed bones , external gills , and no ribs .
Some <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; were later found with long ribs , <unk> its &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; ( although more <unk> studies found it to be a &lt; unk &gt; ) .
<unk> <unk> , such as scales and external gills , were found in many well @ - @ preserved &lt; unk &gt; fossils from Germany .
In the early 20th century , &lt; unk &gt; would be recognized as &lt; unk &gt; forms of &lt; unk &gt; lacking many of the typical features that define the group , and is no longer recognized as a distinct group .
Other animals that would later be classified as &lt; unk &gt; were placed in a group called &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> by plate @ - @ like skull bones , small limbs , fish @ - @ like scales , and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Unlike &lt; unk &gt; , they did not have <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , small <unk> in their skulls behind their eye &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of &lt; unk &gt; .
Their &lt; unk &gt; vertebrae , &lt; unk &gt; , and lack of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( which attached the head to the neck ) were features that were also shared with <unk> .
Thus , they were considered a link between early <unk> and more advanced forms such as &lt; unk &gt; .
Another group called &lt; unk &gt; was named by Cope in <unk> .
Cope classified &lt; unk &gt; as a &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; , placing many small , amphibian @ - @ like animals within it .
Among them were &lt; unk &gt; , once placed in &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; was later placed as a &lt; unk &gt; with other &lt; unk &gt; , but <unk> existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians .
By the end of the 19th century , most of what are today regarded as &lt; unk &gt; were placed in the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
American paleontologist &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> called it &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; or &quot; true &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
The names &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; were used &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> to the order in which it <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , both of which contain &lt; unk &gt; , were distinct from &lt; unk &gt; .
Within &lt; unk &gt; were the groups &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; .
Members of &lt; unk &gt; , such as &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , had &lt; unk &gt; vertebrae with enlarged &lt; unk &gt; that displaced the &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; , such as &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; , had lost their &lt; unk &gt; , and the &lt; unk &gt; made up the entire body of the vertebrae .
&lt; unk &gt; had &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; that were of equal size .
&lt; unk &gt; are now identified as &lt; unk &gt; <unk> related to &lt; unk &gt; .
In <unk> , von &lt; unk &gt; divided &lt; unk &gt; among three <unk> : &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; .
He placed &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; , a group which he <unk> as having simple , &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ shaped &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; included forms with the &lt; unk &gt; divided into &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
All members of &lt; unk &gt; had &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; composed only of the &lt; unk &gt; .
Cope <unk> to von &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s classification , considering the vertebrae of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> because each had a simple &lt; unk &gt; shape .
He continued to use &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ( which he <unk> referred to as &lt; unk &gt; ) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; became a commonly used name at the turn of the century .
&lt; unk &gt; included both &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; in the group .
Cope &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; fell out of use .
In <unk> , British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson proposed that the <unk> history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae .
&lt; unk &gt; forms in the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> into &lt; unk &gt; forms in the &lt; unk &gt; , and finally into &lt; unk &gt; in the &lt; unk &gt; .
More <unk> , Watson began using the term &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> to these groups .
The name &lt; unk &gt; was rarely used in the decades that followed .
<unk> paleontologist &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; removed &lt; unk &gt; from the group , <unk> its scope to &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
His classification of &lt; unk &gt; was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae .
American paleontologist Alfred &lt; unk &gt; brought the name &lt; unk &gt; back into use in the later 20th century .
&lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; used the name &lt; unk &gt; in a <unk> sense ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) to <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; agreed with this classification , but used the name &lt; unk &gt; to avoid <unk> with &lt; unk &gt; in its wider sense ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) .
Unlike modern &lt; unk &gt; classification , however , &lt; unk &gt; included the primitive &lt; unk &gt; in the group .

During the latest &lt; unk &gt; and Early &lt; unk &gt; around 300 &lt; unk &gt; , several groups , such as the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; evolved strong , <unk> limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the &lt; unk &gt; , developed into large &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .

Other &lt; unk &gt; , such as &lt; unk &gt; , developed long &lt; unk &gt; and a close <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; , although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group .

They have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by <unk> in <unk> environments .

While the latter two groups soon became <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; persisted and grew to large <unk> during the <unk> .
Among &lt; unk &gt; , the &lt; unk &gt; flourished in China and the &lt; unk &gt; became common in &lt; unk &gt; .

Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , and large &lt; unk &gt; aquatic forms with <unk> vertebrae were placed in the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
With the recent growth of &lt; unk &gt; , this classification is no longer <unk> .

Crown @ - @ group &lt; unk &gt; are descendants of the most recent common <unk> of all living &lt; unk &gt; and stem &lt; unk &gt; are forms that are outside the crown group .
Modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of &lt; unk &gt; , which would place them within crown &lt; unk &gt; .
Below is a cladogram from &lt; unk &gt; et <unk> .
( 2003 ) placing &lt; unk &gt; within crown &lt; unk &gt; : Other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants of &lt; unk &gt; and place &lt; unk &gt; in a more basal position within the stem of &lt; unk &gt; .
Below is a cladogram from &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ( 1999 ) placing &lt; unk &gt; outside crown &lt; unk &gt; : Most <unk> analyses of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> focus on individual families .
One of the first broad @ - @ scale studies of &lt; unk &gt; phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist Andrew &lt; unk &gt; in 1990 .
A 2007 study made a &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; of all &lt; unk &gt; families , <unk> the family @ - @ level trees of previous studies .

&lt; unk &gt; include the Late &lt; unk &gt; genus &lt; unk &gt; and the family &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; has also been included in &lt; unk &gt; , and is the oldest known &lt; unk &gt; family .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; is the oldest species , having been present over <unk> million years <unk> during the &lt; unk &gt; stage of the Early &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> analyses place &lt; unk &gt; outside &lt; unk &gt; in a more derived position .
Other primitive &lt; unk &gt; include &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , both described in 2005 from &lt; unk &gt; , are also primitive yet come from the Late &lt; unk &gt; .
They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> a long ghost <unk> of species that are not yet known in the <unk> record .
In 2000 , <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> Warren produced a revised phylogeny of more derived &lt; unk &gt; , naming several new <unk> .
Two major <unk> were &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; includes the &lt; unk &gt; that were once called &lt; unk &gt; and includes two <unk> , the &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; include small , mostly terrestrial &lt; unk &gt; that may be the ancestors of modern amphibians .
&lt; unk &gt; include larger &lt; unk &gt; like &lt; unk &gt; .
The second major clade , &lt; unk &gt; , includes most &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , as well as some &lt; unk &gt; groups .
Within &lt; unk &gt; are the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and the most derived &lt; unk &gt; , the &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; and Warren also named &lt; unk &gt; , a clade of small aquatic &lt; unk &gt; from the &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; .
They placed &lt; unk &gt; within &lt; unk &gt; , but more recent studies <unk> on their position .
For example , a 2007 study places them even more basal than &lt; unk &gt; , while a 2008 study <unk> them as basal &lt; unk &gt; .
Within &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and Warren erected two major <unk> : &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; include large &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; like &lt; unk &gt; with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull .
&lt; unk &gt; include a <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , including large <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , aquatic &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; that survived into the <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; with eyes near the front of their heads .
In 2000 , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and Andrew &lt; unk &gt; named a third major clade of &lt; unk &gt; , the &lt; unk &gt; .
This group included more primitive &lt; unk &gt; that could not be placed in either &lt; unk &gt; or &lt; unk &gt; , and included groups like &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; .
While &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; are still widely used , &lt; unk &gt; is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses .
&lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; are now grouped with &lt; unk &gt; , but &lt; unk &gt; are still considered to be a primitive family of &lt; unk &gt; .
A new phylogeny of &lt; unk &gt; was offered by paleontologist &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in 2013 .
It supported many of the <unk> that were found by &lt; unk &gt; and Warren , but it did not find support for their division of derived &lt; unk &gt; into &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; were found to be more closely related to &lt; unk &gt; than to &lt; unk &gt; , which were grouped with &lt; unk &gt; .
The clade including &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; was named &lt; unk &gt; .
In addition , &lt; unk &gt; named the clade containing all &lt; unk &gt; except &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> the name &lt; unk &gt; for the clade containing all &lt; unk &gt; except &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
Below is the cladogram from &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s analysis : = = = <unk> to modern amphibians = = = Modern amphibians ( frogs , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; ) are classified in &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; appear to have <unk> in the &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> clock estimates place the first &lt; unk &gt; in the Late &lt; unk &gt; , but the first member of &lt; unk &gt; ( frogs and &lt; unk &gt; , but not &lt; unk &gt; ) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle &lt; unk &gt; using the same technique .
<unk> <unk> evidence , there are three main <unk> for the <unk> of modern amphibians .
One is that they evolved from &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Another is that they evolved from &lt; unk &gt; , most likely the &lt; unk &gt; .
A third <unk> is that &lt; unk &gt; <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; and frogs and &lt; unk &gt; evolved from &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> , the theory that &lt; unk &gt; were the ancestors of all &lt; unk &gt; has gained wide support .
The skull <unk> of some small &lt; unk &gt; has been compared to those of modern frogs and &lt; unk &gt; , but the presence of &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; teeth in small , &lt; unk &gt; or <unk> &lt; unk &gt; has been cited as the most <unk> argument in favor of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; and many &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; teeth have &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and bases .
During the development of most &lt; unk &gt; , teeth begin to &lt; unk &gt; at their <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; normally <unk> <unk> to the base of the tooth , but &lt; unk &gt; from the tip stops <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; teeth .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> at the base , leaving an area in the center of the tooth &lt; unk &gt; .
This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils .
The &lt; unk &gt; family &lt; unk &gt; is thought to be most closely related to &lt; unk &gt; .
In 2008 , an &lt; unk &gt; called &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was named from Texas and was <unk> the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; for its <unk> @ - @ like head and &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ like body .
It was thought to be the most closely related &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; and was placed as the sister <unk> of the group in a <unk> analysis .
Another species of &lt; unk &gt; called &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; is now thought to be even more closely related to &lt; unk &gt; .
Unlike &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; was known since 1969 , and the presence of &lt; unk &gt; teeth in its <unk> has led some <unk> to <unk> soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians .
It was first described as a &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , and the specific name &lt; unk &gt; means &quot; connecting &quot; in reference to its <unk> <unk> position between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
The structure of its &lt; unk &gt; , a <unk> @ - @ like <unk> that functions like an ear drum , is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship .
Other features including the shape of the <unk> and the back of the skull , the short ribs , and the <unk> skull surface also point to it being a closer relative of &lt; unk &gt; than is &lt; unk &gt; .
Below is a cladogram modified from &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ( 2010 ) showing the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; : = = &lt; unk &gt; = = = = = <unk> = = = Although the earliest &lt; unk &gt; were primarily &lt; unk &gt; , they had the ability to <unk> on land .
Later , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , some well adapted to terrestrial life , also fed on land .
Some &lt; unk &gt; became better adapted toward life in water , and <unk> their <unk> toward aquatic <unk> .
The first primarily aquatic &lt; unk &gt; were &lt; unk &gt; in the &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding .
Most aquatic &lt; unk &gt; have flattened heads .
When feeding , they probably opened their <unk> by lifting their skulls instead of <unk> their lower <unk> .
The jaw <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted .
&lt; unk &gt; is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the &lt; unk &gt; of the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; joint between the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of the skull and the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of the neck .
As the skull is raised , the &lt; unk &gt; bone <unk> forward and causes the lower jaw to &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Other &lt; unk &gt; probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement .
&lt; unk &gt; Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in &lt; unk &gt; .
He envisioned that &lt; unk &gt; , a much larger &lt; unk &gt; than &lt; unk &gt; , was able to make the same movement .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that &lt; unk &gt; also fed in this way .
At the time it was thought that these &lt; unk &gt; lifted their heads with strong jaw <unk> , but it is now thought that they used larger <unk> in the neck that were attached to the large <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; , a close relative of &lt; unk &gt; , also has a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> that <unk> may have attached to .
&lt; unk &gt; has very small teeth and a large area for <unk> <unk> behind the skull , suggesting that it could &lt; unk &gt; <unk> by rapidly opening its mouth .
Unlike &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , terrestrial &lt; unk &gt; have skulls that are adapted for <unk> land @ - @ living prey .
The &lt; unk &gt; between the bones of the skull in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; are able to withstand a high degree of <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; forces would have been experienced when <unk> down on prey .

This tension would have been experienced during &lt; unk &gt; feeding underwater .
&lt; unk &gt; like &lt; unk &gt; were among the first &lt; unk &gt; that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by <unk> .
= = = <unk> = = = &lt; unk &gt; , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments .
Most &lt; unk &gt; probably reproduced through external <unk> .
Like most living frogs , female &lt; unk &gt; would have laid <unk> of eggs in water while <unk> released <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; them .
Several fossils were described from the Early &lt; unk &gt; of Texas in 1998 that may be <unk> <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs .

They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these &lt; unk &gt; laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs .
The &lt; unk &gt; <unk> show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack &lt; unk &gt; ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs .
The eggs are thought to be from &lt; unk &gt; because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar <unk> <unk> .
They are also the most common amphibians from the <unk> in which the eggs were found .

Several types of &lt; unk &gt; do not fully &lt; unk &gt; , but retain features of <unk> such as gills and small body size in what is known as &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; were also &lt; unk &gt; because they retained gills , but they are only known from adult specimens .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , a series of bones that gills would <unk> to in life .
However , some fully mature &lt; unk &gt; also <unk> &lt; unk &gt; bones but did not have external gills .
A dense covering of scales is also seen in <unk> and adults .
Major body changes <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; , including the &lt; unk &gt; and strengthening of skull bones , the &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; bones , and an increase in body size .

In these species , the shape and <unk> of skull bones change in the early stages of development .
The <unk> on the surface of the skull roof also <unk> at this time .
Small , <unk> <unk> <unk> are the first to form , followed by larger <unk> .
As development continues , the external gills <unk> .
Small teeth that once covered the <unk> are lost .
The &lt; unk &gt; <unk> does not develop at the same rate as the skull , with <unk> ( the replacement of <unk> by bone ) <unk> more slowly .
&lt; unk &gt; and limb bones are poorly developed , ribs and <unk> are absent in the early stages , and the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; are entirely absent through most of development .
Once <unk> is reached , most bones have fully formed and growth rate <unk> .
The bones of some &lt; unk &gt; like &lt; unk &gt; show growth marks , possibly an <unk> that growth rate <unk> with the change in seasons .

An entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of <unk> among specimens , but the lack of &lt; unk &gt; adapted adult forms suggests that these &lt; unk &gt; were &lt; unk &gt; .
Unlike other &lt; unk &gt; , their &lt; unk &gt; <unk> developed quickly but were still partly &lt; unk &gt; when fully mature .

&lt; unk &gt; individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this <unk> , and could probably move about on land .
To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle , a &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s limb bones would have to &lt; unk &gt; with positive &lt; unk &gt; , meaning that they would <unk> at a greater rate than the rest of the body .
This is not the case in &lt; unk &gt; , meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle .

The &lt; unk &gt; likely evolved from the &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The positioning of the &lt; unk &gt; and the shape of the &lt; unk &gt; region suggests that the &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; and frogs are &lt; unk &gt; , but the &lt; unk &gt; of these amphibians are no longer considered &lt; unk &gt; with the hearing systems of reptiles , <unk> , and <unk> .

The ability of the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; to effectively <unk> &lt; unk &gt; is called &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Early &lt; unk &gt; like &lt; unk &gt; have thick &lt; unk &gt; with poor &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing .
Instead , these thick &lt; unk &gt; may have <unk> to support the <unk> that covers the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .

= Dvorak technique = The Dvorak technique ( developed between 1969 and 1984 by <unk> Dvorak ) is a widely used system to <unk> tropical cyclone intensity ( which includes tropical depression , tropical storm , and hurricane / typhoon / intense tropical cyclone &lt; unk &gt; ) based solely on visible and infrared satellite images .
Within the Dvorak satellite strength <unk> for tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower <unk> on its intensity .
The primary patterns used are <unk> band pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ) , shear pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ) , central dense &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ) , central cold cover ( &lt; unk &gt; ) pattern , banding eye pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ) , and eye pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; - &lt; unk &gt; ) .
Both the central dense &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> eye pattern use the size of the &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; pattern &lt; unk &gt; start at &lt; unk &gt; , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 mph , 65 km / h ) .
The shape of the central dense &lt; unk &gt; is also considered .
The eye pattern <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of <unk> and <unk> it with the temperature within the eye itself .
The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone .
Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and &lt; unk &gt; of banding features ) are further <unk> to arrive at a particular T @ - @ number .
The &lt; unk &gt; pattern indicates little development is <unk> , despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly <unk> feature .
Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their <unk> , including the National Hurricane Center &apos; s Tropical <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; Branch ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , the &lt; unk &gt; / &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Branch ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; Command in Pearl Harbor , <unk> .
= = Evolution of the method = = The initial development of this technique occurred in 1969 by <unk> Dvorak , using satellite <unk> of tropical cyclones within the northwest Pacific ocean .
The system as it was initially <unk> involved pattern <unk> of cloud features with a development and <unk> <unk> .
As the technique <unk> through the 1970s and 1980s , <unk> of cloud features became dominant in <unk> tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone &apos; s low @ - @ pressure area .
<unk> of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective <unk> of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes , using the cloud top temperatures within the <unk> and <unk> them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself .
&lt; unk &gt; on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s .
The central <unk> assigned to tropical cyclones have required <unk> , as the original estimates were 5 @ - @ 10 hPa ( 0 @ .
@ 15 @ - @ 0 @ .
@ 29 inHg ) too low in the Atlantic and up to 20 hPa ( 0 @ .
@ 59 inHg ) too high in the northwest Pacific .
This led to the development of a separate wind @ - @ pressure relationship for the northwest Pacific , <unk> by <unk> and <unk> in 1975 , then modified in 1977 .
As human <unk> using the technique lead to &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer <unk> , which have been aided by higher @ - @ resolution satellite imagery and more powerful <unk> .
Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can &lt; unk &gt; over time , <unk> <unk> use a six @ - @ hour <unk> period to lead to more <unk> intensity estimates .
Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998 , which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes ( of hurricane or typhoon strength ) .
It still required a <unk> center placement , keeping some &lt; unk &gt; within the process .
By 2004 , an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which <unk> banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to &lt; unk &gt; determine the tropical cyclone &apos; s center .
A central pressure bias was <unk> in 2004 <unk> to the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; and cloud top temperatures which change with <unk> that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique .
= = <unk> of the method = = In a developing cyclone , the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features , and as they strengthen , they tend to change in appearance in a <unk> manner .
The structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to determine if the storm has weakened , maintained its intensity , or strengthened .
Various central cloud and banding features are compared with &lt; unk &gt; that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity .
If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern , then the technique <unk> the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity ( <unk> cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm ) .
In each case a &quot; T @ - @ number &quot; ( an <unk> for Tropical <unk> ) and a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) value are assigned to the storm .
These <unk> range between 1 ( minimum intensity ) and 8 ( maximum intensity ) .
The T @ - @ number and &lt; unk &gt; value are the same except for weakening storms , in which case the &lt; unk &gt; is higher .
For weakening systems , the &lt; unk &gt; is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for 12 hours , though <unk> from the National Hurricane Center indicates that six hours is more <unk> .
The table at right shows the <unk> surface wind speed and sea level pressure that <unk> to a given T @ - @ number .
The amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per 24 <unk> hour period is limited to 2 @ .
@ 5 T @ - @ numbers per day .
= = = <unk> types = = = Within the Dvorak satellite strength <unk> for tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower <unk> on its intensity .
The primary patterns used are <unk> band pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ) , shear pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ) , central dense &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ) , banding eye pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ) , eye pattern ( &lt; unk &gt; - &lt; unk &gt; ) , and central cold cover ( &lt; unk &gt; ) pattern .
Both the central dense &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> eye pattern <unk> the size of the &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; pattern &lt; unk &gt; start at &lt; unk &gt; , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) ) .
The shape of the central dense &lt; unk &gt; is also considered .
The farther the center is &lt; unk &gt; into the &lt; unk &gt; , the stronger it is deemed .
Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) and 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) can have their center of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> by <unk> within visible and infrared satellite imagery , which makes <unk> of their intensity a challenge .
The &lt; unk &gt; pattern , with its large and quickly developing mass of thick &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame , indicates little development .
When it <unk> , <unk> and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud <unk> &lt; unk &gt; the circulation center .
While it <unk> a &lt; unk &gt; pattern , it is rarely seen .
The eye pattern <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of <unk> and <unk> it with the temperature within the eye itself .
The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone .
Winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the &lt; unk &gt; using rapid <unk> &lt; unk &gt; satellite imagery , whose <unk> are taken minutes <unk> rather than every half @ - @ hour .
Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and &lt; unk &gt; of banding features ) are further <unk> to arrive at a particular T @ - @ number .

The &lt; unk &gt; cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985 – 86 <unk> , <unk> for a <unk> @ - @ Portrait — &lt; unk &gt; .
Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the <unk> Gallery in London , in a showing organised by one of the artist &apos; s early <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
At the time , &lt; unk &gt; was a highly <unk> but respected artist , best known for his 1944 Three Studies for <unk> at the Base of a &lt; unk &gt; , which made him the &lt; unk &gt; terrible of British art .
Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics ; John <unk> , later &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> , at the time dismissed it as a cross between &quot; an &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of its <unk> and an &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; who has come to a bad end &quot; .
In 1989 Lawrence &lt; unk &gt; wrote that the &quot; <unk> of the picture , when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was <unk> .
It was everything &lt; unk &gt; .
The <unk> appearance at once of <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> one of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s most original &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
Art critic and <unk> David Sylvester described it as a <unk> piece from &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s unusually <unk> 1949 – 50 period , and one of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s finest &lt; unk &gt; .
= = 1949 Head series = = &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> is <unk> by sequences of images .
He told Sylvester that his imagination was <unk> by sequences and that &quot; images <unk> other images in me &quot; .
His series were not always planned or painted in sequence ; sometimes paintings are grouped for <unk> but vary in execution and tone .
The idea for the head series came after he returned &lt; unk &gt; , late in 1948 , from a stay in &lt; unk &gt; .
In the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice ; the last surviving canvas from this period is his <unk> ( 1946 ) .
Although he continued to paint , he was a <unk> self critic , given to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; with &lt; unk &gt; , and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948 .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; offered &lt; unk &gt; the opportunity of a <unk> show for the opening of her new <unk> Gallery .
He agreed , but had nothing in reserve to <unk> .
In following years , &lt; unk &gt; became perhaps the most important of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s early <unk> ; she arranged this showing — his debut <unk> exhibition — <unk> him widely and organised &lt; unk &gt; for international &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> 40 years old , &lt; unk &gt; viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with <unk> .
Because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years , he had little choice but to present new works .
He did not have a <unk> plan when he agreed to the show , but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year , and executed five <unk> stronger <unk> in the final weeks before the November exhibition , <unk> the series <unk> in time for the opening .
The paintings depict isolated figures <unk> in <unk> that are &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> .
<unk> early in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s career , they are <unk> in quality , but show a clear progression especially in how they &lt; unk &gt; and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with .
Head I ( actually begun in the winter of 1948 ) and Head II show &lt; unk &gt; pieces of <unk> that broadly <unk> human heads ; they have half @ - @ open eyes and a &lt; unk &gt; , though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human .
<unk> III , IV and V show fully formed &lt; unk &gt; <unk> as men , and are <unk> by a <unk> <unk> .
These two broad ideas &lt; unk &gt; in Head VI , which is as &lt; unk &gt; <unk> as the first two paintings , and as <unk> as the middle three .
In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing <unk> , the first <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s work of the influence of &lt; unk &gt; , while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream .
&lt; unk &gt; said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge .
This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was <unk> heavily and spending most <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> rooms .
The following morning he would often approach his canvas &quot; in a bad mood of <unk> ... under <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> ; I sometimes <unk> knew what I was doing . &quot;
He incorporated his <unk> for chance into his work : an image often would &lt; unk &gt; mid @ - @ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended .
He <unk> sought out this freedom and felt it <unk> to his progression as an artist .
To him , lifestyle and art were <unk> ; he said that &quot; perhaps the <unk> helped me to be a bit &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather &lt; unk &gt; study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and arrived at an image that was to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; for the subsequent 20 years .
The series marks &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s first attempt at <unk> <unk> figures in rooms .
For him , the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated , &lt; unk &gt; , and had abandoned the need to present an <unk> face .
He believed that under these circumstances all &lt; unk &gt; falls away , and the social being becomes the <unk> of its &lt; unk &gt; , which &lt; unk &gt; attempted to <unk> by reducing the subject to its <unk> @ - @ bones features : a mouth , ears , eyes , a jaw .
According to <unk> , &quot; the view out front <unk> to be the only one , and our person is suddenly &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , and subject to strange &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
<unk> observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all <unk> of painting , the figures are always <unk> , and usually <unk> aware that they are being portrayed .
This &lt; unk &gt; is abandoned in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s series .
Head I , completed late in 1948 , is considered more successful than Head II .
Although it is well @ - @ regarded <unk> , Head II is seen as something of a creative &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ de @ - @ <unk> , while <unk> III , IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards Head VI .
It is <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; that works of their relative poor quality survive ; he was &lt; unk &gt; self @ - @ critical and often &lt; unk &gt; or abandoned &lt; unk &gt; before they were completed .
When <unk> again by &lt; unk &gt; in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been &lt; unk &gt; for a year , he was full of <unk> and destroyed most of what he had been working on , including several other &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; commissioned another showing to be held in 1950 , for which &lt; unk &gt; painted three large &lt; unk &gt; <unk> on &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s portrait .
The <unk> <unk> the show as &quot; Francis &lt; unk &gt; : Three Studies from the <unk> of Innocent X by &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , but in the end &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> with the works and destroyed them before the show opened .
= = <unk> = = The figure is clearly <unk> as a pope from his clothing .
It seems trapped and isolated within the <unk> of an <unk> three @ - @ <unk> glass cage .
This <unk> <unk> , described by Sylvester as a &quot; space @ - @ frame &quot; , was to feature heavily throughout the artist &apos; s career .
A &lt; unk &gt; <unk> from the upper edge of the glass case , falling just in front of the pope &apos; s face and partially covering his eyes .
It is too &lt; unk &gt; drawn to <unk> with <unk> , but given the presence of similar <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s later works , may be either the end of a <unk> light switch or the &lt; unk &gt; of a curtain ; the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; was to become a signature for the artist .
<unk> from its <unk> meaning , it has a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , <unk> the painting with a further set of <unk> lines .
<unk> an <unk> <unk> most <unk> in the centre <unk> of his 1973 &lt; unk &gt; , May – June 1973 , where it is clearly a <unk> light <unk> .
For &lt; unk &gt; , these elements were intended to make the figure &lt; unk &gt; in and out of sight for the viewer , <unk> to the fact that <unk> can be on or off , &lt; unk &gt; open or closed .
The figure &apos; s mouth is opened wide as if screaming , an <unk> &lt; unk &gt; took from a still he kept of the <unk> screaming in &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> <unk> <unk> sequence in his <unk> <unk> film Battleship &lt; unk &gt; .
In 1984 , the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; <unk> asked &lt; unk &gt; about the still , and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed <unk> with the &lt; unk &gt; of the human mouth .
&lt; unk &gt; replied , &quot; I had always thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a &lt; unk &gt; landscape though I never succeeded in doing so . &quot;
When <unk> asked why he thought he had failed , &lt; unk &gt; said , &quot; It should be all much more <unk> , should have got more of the interior of the mouth , with all the <unk> of the interior of the mouth , but I didn &apos; t <unk> to get it . &quot;
His interest in the mouth was further <unk> by a medical <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> bought in a second @ - @ hand &lt; unk &gt; , kept in his studio and to which he often referred to .
The glass cage might <unk> a <unk> that the figure &apos; s voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming in <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; later in life , &lt; unk &gt; said that he had &quot; wanted to paint the scream more than the <unk> .
I think , if I had really thought about what causes <unk> to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more successful &quot; .
The work <unk> <unk> of the Second World War .
The glass <unk> of his 1949 Chicago <unk> for a Portrait is often seen as &lt; unk &gt; photographs of Adolf &lt; unk &gt; 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court , when he was held within a similar cage .
&lt; unk &gt; strongly <unk> <unk> <unk> though , and stated that he used the <unk> so he could frame and &quot; really see the image – for no other reason .
I know it &apos; s been interpreted as being many other things . &quot;
Other critics saw <unk> between the glass case and the radio &lt; unk &gt; of late 1930s <unk> who <unk> against the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> <unk> notes that &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> to George <unk> and referred in interviews to &lt; unk &gt; &quot; <unk> <unk> ... and <unk> hands ... <unk> &#91; <unk> &#93; the <unk> <unk> of an &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
= = <unk> = = The so @ - @ called &quot; space frame &quot; had already been used by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in the 1930s , and the two artists became friends in the 1960s .
However &lt; unk &gt; had by 1949 used it only in &lt; unk &gt; <unk> before &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; , and in turn influenced his use in &quot; The <unk> &quot; of 1950 .
A similar two <unk> construct is found in Henry <unk> &apos; s works , notably his &quot; &lt; unk &gt; for King and <unk> &quot; , constructed three years after &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Head .
It is difficult to &lt; unk &gt; how these artists influenced and <unk> each other .
What is notable is that &lt; unk &gt; continued to use the motif , with <unk> until the end of his life .
Sylvester suggests his finest example is the 1970 Three Studies of the <unk> Back .
The full @ - @ length <unk> curtain @ - @ like folds painted in heavy <unk> &lt; unk &gt; are in part influenced by &lt; unk &gt; but also similar to &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> Portrait of <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; the Old <unk> &apos; s <unk> to <unk> and distance the <unk> from the viewer ; the black ground @ - @ paint is visible through the folds , making the <unk> all the more <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; had already used similar forms in his Chicago <unk> , and they were to become a feature of his most <unk> 1950s works , especially in his &quot; screaming &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
He became <unk> with the <unk> or curtain as a motif in painting , and collected many <unk> of works by &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; in which it is employed .
He had begun his career as an interior &lt; unk &gt; and designer of <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; in the mid @ - @ 1930s , and later said that he liked &quot; rooms hung all round with just &lt; unk &gt; hung in even folds &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; or &lt; unk &gt; appear in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s earliest works , notably the 1949 <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , always in portraits and always in front of , rather than behind , the figure .
Head VI is closely <unk> on &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s c .
<unk> Portrait of Innocent X , today in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Gallery , Rome .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> avoided seeing the original , even when he spent three months in Rome in <unk> .
Critics <unk> he was <unk> of being disappointed , or thought that an <unk> knowledge of the painting would <unk> his imagination .
<unk> his <unk> was all @ - @ <unk> and he reproduced <unk> of it &lt; unk &gt; for almost two decades ; an <unk> and <unk> described as &quot; without parallel in the history of art &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s approach <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s in a number of ways : both artists were <unk> , yet &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s broad <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; and freedom with paint contrast with &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> and controlled treatment .
He &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer &apos; s point of view , <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; him .
This was already a common technique in commercial , <unk> photography but in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s hands , &lt; unk &gt; argues , the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Although &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s portrait , he did not try and <unk> the earlier painting .
In interviews , he said that he saw <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s work and that he viewed that social structure and order as , according to art historian &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &quot; obsolete and <unk> &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s approach was to <unk> his subject so he could knock him down again , <unk> making a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> on the treatment of <unk> in both old <unk> and contemporary painting .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting .
The <unk> &apos; s <unk> closely <unk> the original , as does the <unk> and white <unk> of his <unk> , which is built up through broad , thick , <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; .
The influence can be further seen in the gold @ - @ <unk> ornaments on the back of the seat that <unk> on both sides of the figure .
Art historian &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; describes the work as a mixture of &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> that <unk> <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; , while at the same time &lt; unk &gt; his painting .
Sylvester &lt; unk &gt; the influence of late works by &lt; unk &gt; in other aspects , especially in the deep and <unk> <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> of Philip IV , and agrees with identification of &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; as a source .
He believes &lt; unk &gt; <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; the use of parallel heavy folds to create the <unk> of what &lt; unk &gt; described as &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , as seen in the earlier artist &apos; s After the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the <unk> <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Portrait of <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
He believes the folds serve to &quot; push the viewer back &quot; , creating a distance from the subject , an effect he sees as similar to the <unk> between and <unk> and setting ; others view the folds as more closely <unk> the <unk> of a prison .
Sylvester describes them as an &lt; unk &gt; of background &lt; unk &gt; into <unk> that are made to appear as if they pass through the <unk> .
In his &quot; &lt; unk &gt; with Francis &lt; unk &gt; &quot; series of books , he asked &lt; unk &gt; why he found the effect so <unk> .
The artist replied , &quot; <unk> , it means that the <unk> <unk> &apos; t come straight out at you but &lt; unk &gt; slowly and <unk> through the <unk> . &quot;
When asked why he was <unk> to <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; so often , &lt; unk &gt; replied that he had nothing against &lt; unk &gt; per &lt; unk &gt; , but merely sought &quot; an <unk> to use these <unk> , and you can &apos; t give ordinary <unk> that <unk> <unk> without getting into a <unk> of false &lt; unk &gt; manner . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; sees Head VI as a reaction against &lt; unk &gt; , and a commentary on how the <unk> is &quot; obsolete and <unk> &quot; , with a pope <unk> to both <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; .
To him , the figure seems to &quot; <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; of image and tries to <unk> the <unk> collapse of the established work order .
He <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> at arms of his throne . &quot;
Sylvester notes that &lt; unk &gt; was impressed by <unk> &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; and handling of paint , especially in <unk> &apos; s 1930s works ; and suggests that the white &lt; unk &gt; around the pope &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; may be influenced by the 1913 <unk> in a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in an &lt; unk &gt; .
= = Critical reception = = When &lt; unk &gt; <unk> the series late in 1948 he was something of a two @ - @ hit <unk> .
He had success in 1944 with Three Studies for <unk> at the Base of a &lt; unk &gt; and to a <unk> extent with <unk> ( 1946 ) , both of which were highly regarded but viewed as &lt; unk &gt; .
The exhibition was a success , and marked his critical <unk> .
<unk> then , he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional &lt; unk &gt; .
The full show established him in the <unk> of critics as , according to Michael &lt; unk &gt; , &quot; more of a force to be &lt; unk &gt; with in the contemporary scene &quot; .
While some found his images &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , they wrote about him all the same , <unk> his reputation as the &lt; unk &gt; terrible of post @ - @ war British art .
The critic for The Observer wrote , &quot; The recent paintings ... &lt; unk &gt; as they are , cannot be <unk> .
<unk> they are <unk> , and the <unk> handling of large areas of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> or green , only makes me <unk> the more that the artist &apos; s <unk> should have been brought to subjects so <unk> &quot; .
Most critics focused on <unk> I and VI , <unk> <unk> on the progression between the two .
While some found the <unk> violence of the paintings &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; was a <unk> <unk> and turned the bad press into <unk> , and brought &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s work to national attention .
&lt; unk &gt; notes that the exhibition showed &lt; unk &gt; no longer needed &lt; unk &gt; material to make an impact , and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means , and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought , by presenting his <unk> &quot; in a &lt; unk &gt; setting , a cage or &#91; behind &#93; a parted &lt; unk &gt; ... the rest , the most essential , lay in the <unk> of the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; medium of oil paint &quot; .
After the showing &lt; unk &gt; gradually became &quot; less the &lt; unk &gt; with an occasional image of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and more a force to be &lt; unk &gt; with on the contemporary scene &quot; .
His reputation and the value of his panels rose <unk> , and after the showing he was sought after by European , American and African <unk> and <unk> , commanding <unk> as high as £ 400 for single works , unusual for a contemporary British artist of the time .
= = &lt; unk &gt; = = Head VI was first exhibited at the <unk> Gallery , London , in 1949 .
It was acquired by the Arts Council &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; Gallery in 1952 .
The &lt; unk &gt; has loaned it out a number of times since , including for major &lt; unk &gt; at the Grand &lt; unk &gt; , Paris in 1971 , and the Hugh <unk> Gallery , <unk> , in 2000 .
In May 1996 , the National Gallery took on loan &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Innocent X portrait and hung it alongside four &lt; unk &gt; paintings ; Head VI , <unk> I ( 1951 ) , <unk> 1961 and <unk> 1965 .
&lt; unk &gt; believes that &lt; unk &gt; would have <unk> of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted , but writes that two , including Head VI , &quot; stood up to it , and even enhanced its authority as one of the most <unk> studies of human nature and human power &quot; .

&lt; unk &gt; has been described as the most influential movement in English poetry since the activity of the Pre @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; .
As a poetic style it gave &lt; unk &gt; its start in the early 20th century , and is considered to be the first organized &lt; unk &gt; literary movement in the English language .
&lt; unk &gt; is sometimes viewed as &apos; a <unk> of creative moments &apos; rather than any continuous or sustained period of development .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; remarked that &apos; It is more accurate to consider &lt; unk &gt; not as a <unk> , nor even as a poetic school , but as the <unk> of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles &apos; .
The &lt; unk &gt; rejected the <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; typical of much <unk> and Victorian poetry , in contrast to their <unk> , the <unk> poets , who were generally content to work within that tradition .
In contrast , &lt; unk &gt; called for a return to what were seen as more <unk> values , such as &lt; unk &gt; of presentation and economy of language , as well as a <unk> to <unk> with non @ - @ traditional verse forms .
&lt; unk &gt; use free verse .
&lt; unk &gt; publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most prominent <unk> figures , both in poetry and in other fields .
The &lt; unk &gt; group was <unk> in London , with members from Great Britain , Ireland and the United States .
&lt; unk &gt; unusually for the time , a number of women writers were major &lt; unk &gt; figures .
A characteristic feature of &lt; unk &gt; is its attempt to <unk> a single image to reveal its <unk> .

They continued to work in this <unk> into the early years of the 20th century .
As the new century opened , Austin was still the serving British <unk> <unk> , a post which he held up to 1913 .
In the century &apos; s first decade , poetry still had a large audience ; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy &apos; s The &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> &lt; unk &gt; Works , Ernest &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Poems , George <unk> &apos; s <unk> Poems , Robert Service &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; of a &lt; unk &gt; and John &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; and Poems .

Writing in A. R. &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s magazine The New Age , the poet and critic F. S. Flint ( a champion of free verse and modern French poetry ) was highly critical of the club and its publications .
From the <unk> debate , &lt; unk &gt; and Flint became close friends .

For example , in his 1911 – 12 series of <unk> I <unk> the limbs of <unk> , Pound writes of Daniel &apos; s line &quot; &lt; unk &gt; de &lt; unk &gt; m &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; ( &quot; it <unk> me to think of her &quot; ) ( from the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; l &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) : &quot; You cannot get statement <unk> than that , or <unk> , or less &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
These <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> and lack of <unk> were to be <unk> the <unk> qualities of &lt; unk &gt; poetry .
Through his friendship with <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Pound had already developed an interest in Japanese art by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ <unk> <unk> at the British Museum , and he quickly became <unk> in the study of related Japanese verse forms .
In an article in La France , 1915 , the French critic , &lt; unk &gt; de &lt; unk &gt; described the &lt; unk &gt; as descendants of the French &lt; unk &gt; and in a 1928 letter to the French critic and <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Pound was keen to <unk> another <unk> for &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> out that &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> to a &lt; unk &gt; tradition , <unk> back via William Butler Yeats , Arthur <unk> and the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; Club generation of British poets to &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; source was <unk> further in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s study published in <unk> , in which he concluded however great the <unk> of technique and language &apos; between the image of the &lt; unk &gt; and the &apos; <unk> &apos; of the &lt; unk &gt; there is a difference only of precision &apos; .
In 1915 , Pound edited the poetry of another 1890s poet , <unk> Johnson for the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
In his introduction , he wrote = = Early publications and <unk> of intent = = In 1911 , Pound introduced two other poets to the &lt; unk &gt; Tower group : his former <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ( who had started signing her work &lt; unk &gt; ) and her future husband Richard &lt; unk &gt; .
These two were interested in <unk> Greek poetic models , especially &lt; unk &gt; , an interest that Pound shared .
The <unk> of <unk> that they achieved by following the Greek example <unk> the <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; interest in Japanese poetry , and , in 1912 , during a meeting with them in the British Museum <unk> room , Pound told &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; that they were &lt; unk &gt; and even &lt; unk &gt; the signature &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; to some poems they were <unk> .
When <unk> <unk> started her Poetry magazine in 1911 , she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor .
In October 1912 , he <unk> &lt; unk &gt; three poems each by &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; under the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , ( published in the November 1912 second issue &lt; unk &gt; ) with a note which described &lt; unk &gt; as &apos; one of the &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; .
This note , along with the &lt; unk &gt; note ( &apos; The <unk> Works of T. S. &lt; unk &gt; &apos; ) in Pound &apos; s book ( also published in <unk> 1912 ) entitled &lt; unk &gt; are considered to be first appearances of the word &lt; unk &gt; ( later &lt; unk &gt; to &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; ) in <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s poems , &lt; unk &gt; , To a Greek &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , were in the November issue of Poetry , and &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s , <unk> of the <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; , appeared in the January 1913 issue ; &lt; unk &gt; as a movement was launched .
Poetry &apos; s April issue published what came to be seen as &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> text &quot; , the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ like poem of Ezra Pound entitled &quot; In a <unk> of the Metro &quot; : The &lt; unk &gt; of these <unk> in the crowd ; &lt; unk &gt; on a <unk> , black &lt; unk &gt; .
The March 1913 issue of Poetry contained A <unk> Don &lt; unk &gt; by an &lt; unk &gt; and the <unk> entitled &lt; unk &gt; both written by Pound , with the latter being attributed to Flint .
The latter contained this &lt; unk &gt; statement of the group &apos; s position : <unk> treatment of the &quot; thing &quot; , whether &lt; unk &gt; or objective .
To use <unk> no word that does not <unk> to the presentation .
As <unk> rhythm : to <unk> in sequence of the musical <unk> , not in sequence of the &lt; unk &gt; .
Pound &apos; s note opened with a <unk> of an image as &quot; that which presents an <unk> and emotional complex in an <unk> of time &quot; .
Pound <unk> on to state , &quot; It is better to present one <unk> in a <unk> than to produce &lt; unk &gt; works &quot; .
His list of &quot; don &lt; unk &gt; &quot; reinforced his three <unk> in &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , while warning that they should not be considered as &lt; unk &gt; but as the &quot; result of long <unk> &quot; .
<unk> together , these two <unk> <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past .
&lt; unk &gt; Flint commented &quot; we have never claimed to have invented the <unk> .
We do not <unk> that our ideas are original . &quot;
The 1916 <unk> to Some &lt; unk &gt; Poets comments &quot; &lt; unk &gt; does not merely mean the presentation of <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; refers to the manner of presentation , not to the subject . &quot;
= = <unk> &lt; unk &gt; = = &lt; unk &gt; to promote the work of the &lt; unk &gt; , and particularly of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , Pound decided to <unk> an anthology under the title <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
It was first published in Alfred &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s little magazine The &lt; unk &gt; and was later published in 1914 by Alfred and Charles &lt; unk &gt; in New York and by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; at the Poetry &lt; unk &gt; in London .
It became one of the most important and influential English @ - @ language collections of <unk> verse .
<unk> in the thirty @ - @ seven poems were ten poems by &lt; unk &gt; , seven by &lt; unk &gt; , and six by Pound .
The book also included work by &lt; unk &gt; Flint , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , Amy Lowell , William Carlos Williams , James <unk> , Ford &lt; unk &gt; Ford , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and John &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was also another included in the important 1963 anthology by William <unk> The &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Modern Poetry in <unk> .
Pound &apos; s <unk> choices were based on what he saw as the degree of <unk> that these writers displayed with &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , rather than active <unk> in a group as such .
Williams , who was based in the United States , had not participated in any of the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; Tower group .
However , he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the <unk> of poetry along similar lines .
Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound , as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier , Pre @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ influenced style towards a <unk> , more modern way of writing .
The <unk> of a poem by <unk> , I <unk> an Army , which was sent to Pound by &lt; unk &gt; Yeats , took on a wider importance in the history of literary &lt; unk &gt; , as the subsequent <unk> between the two led to the <unk> publication , at Pound &apos; s <unk> , of A Portrait of the <unk> as a Young Man in The &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> &apos; s poem is not written in free verse , but in <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
However , it strongly <unk> Pound &apos; s interest in poems written to be <unk> to music , such as those by the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The book met with little popular or critical success , at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to <unk> what the poets were attempting to do , and a number of copies were returned to the <unk> .
= = Some &lt; unk &gt; Poets = = The following year , Pound and Flint fell out over their different <unk> of the history and <unk> of the group <unk> from an article on the history of &lt; unk &gt; written by Flint and published in The &lt; unk &gt; in May 1915 .
Flint was at <unk> to <unk> the contribution of the &lt; unk &gt; Tower poets , especially Edward &lt; unk &gt; .
Pound , who believed that the &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; that he saw as the <unk> quality of the poems of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; was likely to be <unk> by the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; of &lt; unk &gt; , was to play no further direct role in the history of the &lt; unk &gt; .
He went on to co @ - @ found the &lt; unk &gt; with his friend , the <unk> and writer &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Around this time , the American &lt; unk &gt; Amy Lowell moved to London , determined to promote her own work and that of the other &lt; unk &gt; poets .
Lowell was a wealthy &lt; unk &gt; from Boston whose brother <unk> Lawrence Lowell was President of Harvard University from <unk> @ - @ 1933 .
She <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
She was also an <unk> champion of literary <unk> who was willing to use her money to <unk> the group .
Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> to a more <unk> manner .
This new <unk> policy was stated in the &lt; unk &gt; to the first anthology to appear under her leadership : &quot; In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former <unk> .
Instead of an <unk> selection by an editor , each poet has been <unk> to represent himself by the work he <unk> his best , the only &lt; unk &gt; being that it should not yet have appeared in book form . &quot;
The outcome was a series of &lt; unk &gt; anthologies under the title Some &lt; unk &gt; Poets .
The first of these appeared in 1915 , planned and assembled mainly by &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
Two further issues , both edited by Lowell , were published in 1916 and 1917 .
These three volumes featured most of the original poets , ( also including &lt; unk &gt; poetry by the American poet John <unk> <unk> ) , with the exception of Pound , who had tried to <unk> her to <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; name from her publications and who &lt; unk &gt; dubbed this phase of &lt; unk &gt; &quot; Amy @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
Lowell <unk> D. H. Lawrence to <unk> poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes , making him the only writer to <unk> as both a <unk> poet and an &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> also became associated with the group during this period .
However , with World War I as a <unk> , the times were not easy for <unk> @ - @ <unk> literary <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; , for example , spent much of the war at the front ) , and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the &lt; unk &gt; as a movement .
= = &lt; unk &gt; after &lt; unk &gt; = = In <unk> , Walter &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; suggested that &lt; unk &gt; should produce a new &lt; unk &gt; anthology .
&lt; unk &gt; , by now a successful <unk> , took up the <unk> and enlisted the help of Ford and &lt; unk &gt; The result was the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> 1930 , edited by &lt; unk &gt; and including all the <unk> to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell , who had died , &lt; unk &gt; , who had disappeared , and Pound , who declined .
The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the &lt; unk &gt; in the history of 20th @ - @ century poetry .
Of the poets who were published in the various &lt; unk &gt; anthologies , <unk> , Lawrence and &lt; unk &gt; are now primarily <unk> and read as <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> , who was at most a <unk> member of the group , carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an &lt; unk &gt; concern with <unk> of language .
William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along <unk> American lines with his <unk> foot and a <unk> he claimed was taken &quot; from the <unk> of Polish <unk> &quot; .
Both Pound and &lt; unk &gt; turned to writing long poems , but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an &lt; unk &gt; legacy .
Most of the other members of the group are largely <unk> outside the context of the history of &lt; unk &gt; .
= = <unk> = = Despite the movement &apos; s short life , &lt; unk &gt; would <unk> influence the course of <unk> poetry in English .
Richard &lt; unk &gt; , in his 1941 <unk> , writes : &quot; I think the poems of Ezra Pound , &lt; unk &gt; , Lawrence , and Ford &lt; unk &gt; Ford will continue to be read .
And to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and his <unk> have carried on their operations from positions won by the &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
On the other hand , Wallace Stevens found <unk> in the &lt; unk &gt; approach : &quot; Not all <unk> are equal .
The vice of &lt; unk &gt; was that it did not <unk> this . &quot;
With its <unk> for <unk> , <unk> and precision and its <unk> on <unk> to appearances <unk> with its <unk> of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; had later effects that are &lt; unk &gt; in T. S. Eliot &apos; s &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; and &apos; <unk> at the <unk> &apos; and in D. H. Lawrence &apos; s animal and <unk> pieces .
The <unk> of conventional verse forms in the <unk> @ - @ <unk> owed much to the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of the <unk> Poetry style .
The influence of &lt; unk &gt; can be seen clearly in the work of the &lt; unk &gt; poets , who came to <unk> in the 1930s under the <unk> of Pound and Williams .
The &lt; unk &gt; worked mainly in free verse .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s principles with &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s , Louis &lt; unk &gt; insisted , in his introduction to the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; issue of Poetry , on writing &quot; which is the detail , not &lt; unk &gt; , of seeing , of thinking with the things as they exist , and of <unk> them along a line of melody . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; was a major influence on the <unk> poets , who carried the &lt; unk &gt; focus on formal concerns to a high level of development .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; , another &lt; unk &gt; poet , was a key figure in the early development of the British Poetry <unk> , a loose movement that also <unk> the influence of the San Francisco <unk> poets .
&lt; unk &gt; influenced a number of poetry <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; the &lt; unk &gt; Free verse became a <unk> and acquired status as a <unk> poetic form .
In the 1950s , especially , with the <unk> generation , the Black Mountain poets , and others associated with the San Francisco <unk> .
In his <unk> 1950 <unk> &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , Charles &lt; unk &gt; , the <unk> of the Black Mountain group , wrote &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; A &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; ; his &lt; unk &gt; derived from and <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; .
Among the <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> <unk> in particular were influenced by the &lt; unk &gt; emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry .

However , the US and other foreign <unk> were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain <unk> .
It also became apparent that the rebels had an <unk> command @ - @ and @ - @ control structure , making it impossible to <unk> any ceasefire or <unk> of <unk> passage .
Likewise , government troops faced a command @ - @ and @ - @ control problem ; reports indicated that army units were <unk> along <unk> lines , in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different <unk> when given orders they <unk> with .
Thus , it became clear that <unk> passage to the airport would not be possible .

On 4 January , several <unk> , including a couple <unk> of gunfire , suggested that the embassy &apos; s security detail was insufficient to hold off armed &lt; unk &gt; until the USS Guam and USS &lt; unk &gt; arrived with their helicopters and soldiers , at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January .

However , <unk> in <unk> seemed <unk> and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to <unk> that many ships from the <unk> Gulf , thus the decision to send two of the closest ships .
Although the two vessels were selected by mid @ - @ afternoon on 2 January , the transfer of some personnel from <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; caused a <unk> of eight to ten hours .

During the first &lt; unk &gt; , a <unk> <unk> on one of the helicopters , &lt; unk &gt; soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the Guam ; problems with the helicopters &apos; <unk> system also complicated the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The helicopters arrived in Mogadishu at dawn , crossing the coast just south of the <unk> at 25 – 50 feet ( 7 @ .
@ 6 – 15 @ .
@ 2 m ) in <unk> on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city .
On their arrival in Mogadishu , the crew of the helicopters were using an <unk> 1969 map , which showed the embassy in an isolated area .
Furthermore , they had been told the embassy could be <unk> by its white <unk> perimeter wall and <unk> course .
The embassy was , in fact , surrounded by new development and the crew saw white <unk> walls around many buildings in the city .
The helicopters were flying too low to spot a &lt; unk &gt; light which was placed on the embassy &apos; s water tower ( the highest point within the embassy compound ) and the <unk> course in the embassy compound had a black , oil @ - @ <unk> surface — not the familiar green <unk> that the helicopter crew would &lt; unk &gt; breaking radio <unk> ( their only direct communication with the embassy was &lt; unk &gt; ) to contact the embassy , they were able to &lt; unk &gt; it and land at 07 : 10 .
As they arrived , a group of about 100 to 150 &lt; unk &gt; were attempting to enter the embassy compound via &lt; unk &gt; on the wall , but scattered as the helicopters arrived .
The security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the Air Force &apos; s <unk> @ - @ 130 arrived to provide overhead support .
Ambassador Bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the rules of engagement : they could only use <unk> force if people came over the embassy compound &apos; s walls with obvious <unk> intent .
He also identified three zones of defense , stating a <unk> to retreat to the third zone before the use of <unk> force : the entire embassy compound the <unk> , Joint <unk> Office ( &lt; unk &gt; ) building , Marine House , and the helicopter landing zone ( &lt; unk &gt; ) the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; buildings ( the two &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; buildings where the &lt; unk &gt; were held ) Ambassador Bishop clearly explained his <unk> to the security detail , which was to avoid any <unk> that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu .
He <unk> that the embassy would be <unk> by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the <unk> that the US was intervening in the conflict .
To this effect , he requested the <unk> of America and BBC broadcast <unk> that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not <unk> in the conflict .
The Marines who had been &lt; unk &gt; in fuel during the &lt; unk &gt; were able to take a <unk> and <unk> their <unk> .
After an hour on the ground , the helicopters left with the first 61 &lt; unk &gt; , including all American civilians and four heads of mission .
&lt; unk &gt; were provided <unk> on one of the flights to remain warm .
&lt; unk &gt; with the only in @ - @ flight &lt; unk &gt; on the return nearly prevented &lt; unk &gt; , which would have forced the helicopters to <unk> to the Somali desert and <unk> a rescue .

The Office of Military <unk> , just one and a half blocks from the embassy , required evacuation .
Despite its <unk> to the embassy , an armed <unk> was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest .
A <unk> of vehicles with several Marines and &lt; unk &gt; left the embassy at 8 : 47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the &lt; unk &gt; ( four Americans , a &lt; unk &gt; , and 17 &lt; unk &gt; ) .
This was the only &lt; unk &gt; outside the embassy by the security detail .
Throughout the day , foreign diplomats <unk> the embassy &lt; unk &gt; to be evacuated ; the US <unk> these <unk> , but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy .
A Somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy , Major Siad , agreed to travel to rescue the German &lt; unk &gt; d &lt; unk &gt; and British ambassador ( <unk> staff from the British embassy had previously come to the US embassy ) .
The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ; Ambassador Bishop , a <unk> partner of his Soviet <unk> , agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy .

At the request of Ambassador Bishop , Major Siad agreed to transport the <unk> , but only if he was paid enough ; the US embassy paid Major Siad , who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff .
The brother of President <unk> , who was also a Major General and Chief of Police , showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated , but was turned away after a <unk> <unk> with the ambassador .
The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , which was set up in the &lt; unk &gt; .

However , this was <unk> over <unk> from the commander of the security detail .
The <unk> was partially <unk> by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail .
The &lt; unk &gt; were grouped into 15 @ - @ person &quot; <unk> &quot; to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of <unk> <unk> .
Some attempted to bring more , resulting in problems <unk> their evacuation .
Furthermore , many &lt; unk &gt; had <unk> they wanted to bring , which were not allowed .
Most <unk> were killed by their <unk> ; some were given <unk> .
Meanwhile , the soldiers were allowed to <unk> anything they wanted from the embassy &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; , such as <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , and <unk> ( most had been stationed on ships for several months ) .
They were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy ; the &lt; unk &gt; filled several <unk> with medical supplies to return to the ship .

The first wave departed Guam at 23 : 43 .
As the second wave landed , Major Siad arrived at the embassy <unk> accompanied by two &lt; unk &gt; of soldiers and held a <unk> in one hand and a radio in the other .
His request to speak with the ambassador was granted .
Major Siad demanded that the evacuation <unk> immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation .
He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued .
The second and third waves were able to <unk> without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major , who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand <unk> in <unk> and <unk> to the ambassador &apos; s armored car .
Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in <unk> with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to <unk> with the final wave to prevent the Major from &lt; unk &gt; on the deal .

Torres then &quot; went all out on the first <unk> , hiring a full band that included a <unk> <unk> &quot; .
In &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( 2007 ) , Torres produced the singles &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; and &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; and provided background vocals on the <unk> versions of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s past hits .

El Amor &quot; was <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s desire to <unk> &quot; those big , dark events within love that <unk> talks about &quot; ; he continued , &quot; &#91; the &#93; dark sides of love are extremely <unk> to understand its great value . &quot;

He described it as &quot; very strong &quot; and &quot; a bit dark &quot; .
The single marked &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s return to his signature , <unk> sound after the <unk> music influenced &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s lead single &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , a mixture of <unk> and <unk> which failed to make an impact in the United States .

Storms that form east of the date line and north of the <unk> are called <unk> ; see 2003 Pacific hurricane season .
Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Tokyo Typhoon Center .
Tropical depressions in this basin monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) have the &quot; <unk> &quot; &lt; unk &gt; added to their number .
Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA .

The following month , the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26 @ .
@ 7 , indicating a slightly above average season .
Over next two months , however , <unk> in sea surface temperatures , particularly those in the Central Pacific , caused the group to <unk> their <unk> <unk> and indicated the <unk> for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast .
A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the <unk> group to once again <unk> their &lt; unk &gt; to indicate a near @ - @ average season in their final August forecast <unk> , which <unk> 27 tropical storms .
The group was very accurate in their &lt; unk &gt; , with their April and August &lt; unk &gt; being the most accurate .
Similarly , &lt; unk &gt; working with the City University of Hong Kong issued a <unk> <unk> on April 24 , 2003 , indicating the <unk> of a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones , 26 tropical storms , and 16 &lt; unk &gt; .

&lt; unk &gt; <unk> was also <unk> in the same regions , resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines in 2003 ; the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971 – 2000 30 @ - @ year average .
In 2003 , the JMA monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity ; of those , 14 reached typhoon intensity .
Though the number of tropical storms was below average , the <unk> between tropical storms and &lt; unk &gt; was 66 % greater than normal .
The Philippine &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the JMA .
The season began with the formation of Tropical Storm &lt; unk &gt; on January 15 .
After its &lt; unk &gt; five days later , no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months .
This period of <unk> ended with the formation of Typhoon &lt; unk &gt; in mid @ - @ April ; &lt; unk &gt; was one of the longest lived Pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with 1 @ - @ minute sustained winds of at least 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) in April since Typhoon <unk> in 1997 .
Tropical activity was enhanced from May to June , and during this period the JMA monitored four tropical storms , while the PAGASA monitored a fifth storm off the eastern Philippines .
Three of the four tropical storms monitored by the JMA approached or hit Japan , including Typhoon &lt; unk &gt; , which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the &lt; unk &gt; Islands and the Korean <unk> .
Tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of June and first half of July .
The second half of July , however , featured the development of &lt; unk &gt; Imbudo and &lt; unk &gt; , which both tracked westward across the Philippines before striking areas near &lt; unk &gt; and other regions of southeastern China .
Imbudo caused the deaths of 78 people and US $ &lt; unk &gt; million in damage .
August was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis , with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the JMA , JTWC , and PAGASA .
This included &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , which also struck southeastern China .
Typhoon &lt; unk &gt; earlier in the month made landfall in Japan , resulting in 17 deaths .

Tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after August , with October featuring only three tropical storms .
However , two , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , reached typhoon intensity ; both stayed away from land .
November featured less storms but was &lt; unk &gt; average , with two &lt; unk &gt; developing .

Shortly after developing , &lt; unk &gt; caused two <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; in addition to minor agricultural and <unk> damage ; similar effects were felt in Guam .
Several days later , the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other &lt; unk &gt; measures in the Philippines after &lt; unk &gt; indicated the potential for strong winds and rain .
However , ultimately any effects in the archipelago associated with &lt; unk &gt; remained minimal .
The typhoon also prompted warning products in Taiwan , making it the first April typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat .
Unlike in the Philippines , however , &lt; unk &gt; would bring significant rainfall to Taiwan .

This corps was to secure the north shore of the &lt; unk &gt; , block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from <unk> one another and , more <unk> , prevent &lt; unk &gt; from crossing the river and <unk> to Russia .
The new VIII Corps , under the overall command of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry ( see <unk> of Battle below ) .

Although superior in numbers , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s column had no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size .
It was &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s turn to face <unk> at his front and rear , until the arrival of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s column , which had &lt; unk &gt; its way through the mountains in the west .

<unk> , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s division was nearly destroyed ; the 30 percent losses experienced by the French fell predominantly on his division .
&lt; unk &gt; for both sides , the fighting was hard .
The weather had been cold ; an early storm had left <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; &quot; like <unk> &quot; hung from the trees .
For the Coalition , the Russians were secure on the north bank of the &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> reinforcements from &lt; unk &gt; ; the bridges between &lt; unk &gt; and Vienna had been destroyed , making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult , but not impossible .
After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news , the Coalition could claim a difficult and <unk> victory .
The French had <unk> from the field with a badly &lt; unk &gt; division and &lt; unk &gt; had secured the right flank .
<unk> , Francis was so pleased with the outcome at &lt; unk &gt; that he awarded &lt; unk &gt; the Military <unk> of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
For the French , the <unk> of the Corps &lt; unk &gt; seemed nothing short of a <unk> .
The remainder of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s division crossed the river the next morning and eventually &lt; unk &gt; in Vienna , which the French acquired by <unk> later in the month .
More <unk> for them , the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions .
Initially there had been some <unk> and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft .
They had lost control of the boats in the current and <unk> into the <unk> of the burned bridge at &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; their boats .
&lt; unk &gt; into the <unk> river , most had <unk> .
Despite this initial <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s column retained its <unk> , and responded well to various difficult demands .
&lt; unk &gt; had demonstrated his <unk> &lt; unk &gt; : when he heard cannon fire , he directed his troops toward it to support the French division .
In terms of French <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s failure to guard his flank , especially in the face of Napoleon &apos; s direct advice , <unk> influenced his relationship with his commander .
However , in the immediate weeks ahead , the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; did more to <unk> Napoleon than &lt; unk &gt; had .
In <unk> the battle and its aftermath , historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; : &quot; Napoleon , aware of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> and his own &lt; unk &gt; for it , <unk> his <unk> on &lt; unk &gt; , whom he <unk> accused of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> through Vienna . &quot;
After the victory at &lt; unk &gt; , Napoleon dispersed the VIII Corps and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
However disappointed he may have been with &lt; unk &gt; , Napoleon was pleased with &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s performance .
As recognition of his conduct in what the French called &quot; the <unk> Battle of &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , &lt; unk &gt; received the <unk> &apos; s Grand Cross of the <unk> of <unk> .
The loss of &lt; unk &gt; was a significant blow to the Austrian military organization .
<unk> out of <unk> for this specific task , he was one of their most experienced general staff officers , other than the &lt; unk &gt; Charles .
From the summer of 1796 until his <unk> in 1800 he had been Chief of the &lt; unk &gt; General Staff of the Army , the Lower <unk> , the <unk> and the Army of Germany .
Furthermore , he was a <unk> member of &lt; unk &gt; Charles &apos; staff .
He had helped to design several of Charles &apos; more important victories at &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , the &lt; unk &gt; at &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , the battles at &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , and the northern <unk> Campaign of &lt; unk &gt; that included battles at &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
An experienced officer and excellent &lt; unk &gt; , he might well have made a more effective Chief of the &lt; unk &gt; General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; than his eventual replacement , <unk> von &lt; unk &gt; .
In &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s absence &lt; unk &gt; , the architect of the Austrian <unk> at &lt; unk &gt; in 1800 , was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; , <unk> a far better &lt; unk &gt; than &lt; unk &gt; , and possessed of superior training and <unk> <unk> , would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory , but it would have &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> of the Coalition &apos; s losses ; &lt; unk &gt; was considered one of Napoleon &apos; s finest &lt; unk &gt; .
In the <unk> picture , despite the important major naval engagements , the outcome of the War of the Third Coalition was determined on the <unk> , predominantly in the two major land operations .
In the Ulm campaign , the <unk> achieved some minor victories , such as &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s at &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; , but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps .
The latter would not <unk> arms against France until formally exchanged .
This condition <unk> the Austrian military leadership and forced the <unk> of such <unk> as &lt; unk &gt; out of <unk> .
After the capitulation at Ulm , isolated portions of the Austrian military &lt; unk &gt; capture and joined with their Russian allies ; Michael von &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s corps <unk> out of the &lt; unk &gt; and joined &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s force .
A few other small forces refused to &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> <unk> into the <unk> mountains and the &lt; unk &gt; forests , to <unk> in <unk> for &lt; unk &gt; .

<unk> , <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , led his column back through the mountains into Austria , fighting rear guard actions against <unk> French forces at the &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) and &lt; unk &gt; .
These <unk> units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the Austrians could not hold their own against the French .
Between the Ulm capitulation and the Austrian and Russian defeat at &lt; unk &gt; , there were other minor <unk> : a successful &lt; unk &gt; between the cavalry that escaped from Ulm and the French near the town of &lt; unk &gt; , the <unk> victory at &lt; unk &gt; , and another within days at &lt; unk &gt; .
The second <unk> event , the decisive French victory at the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; over the combined Russian and Austrian armies , forced the Austrian <unk> from the Coalition .
The subsequent <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , signed on 26 December 1805 , reinforced the earlier <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
Furthermore , Austria ceded land to Napoleon &apos; s German allies , and paid an <unk> of 40 million <unk> .

However , they are rarely considered for a modern design , the principles behind them having been <unk> by other <unk> which are more accurate in their <unk> of filter response .
= = History = = <unk> k &lt; unk &gt; were invented by George Campbell .
He published his work in <unk> , but had clearly invented the &lt; unk &gt; some time before , as his <unk> at <unk> &amp; T <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , was already making <unk> to the design at this time .
Campbell &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; were far superior to the <unk> single element <unk> that had been used previously .
Campbell called his &lt; unk &gt; electric wave &lt; unk &gt; , but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some <unk> but not others .
Many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented ; an early ( and important ) variation was the m @ - @ derived filter by &lt; unk &gt; who <unk> the term constant k for the Campbell filter in order to distinguish them .
The great advantage Campbell &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; had over the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and other simple &lt; unk &gt; of the time was that they could be designed for any <unk> degree of stop band <unk> or &lt; unk &gt; of transition between pass band and stop band .
It was only necessary to add more filter sections until the <unk> response was obtained .
The &lt; unk &gt; were designed by Campbell for the purpose of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> on transmission lines , but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that .
The design <unk> used by Campbell have largely been <unk> .
However , the ladder &lt; unk &gt; used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with &lt; unk &gt; of modern filter designs such as the &lt; unk &gt; filter .
Campbell gave constant k designs for low @ - @ pass , high @ - @ pass and band @ - @ pass &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> @ - @ stop and multiple band &lt; unk &gt; are also possible .

Here &quot; L &quot; should not be <unk> with the &lt; unk &gt; L – in electronic filter &lt; unk &gt; , &quot; L &quot; refers to the specific filter shape which <unk> <unk> letter &quot; L &quot; .
The sections of the <unk> <unk> filter are made of series elements having &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; elements with &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The factor of two is introduced for <unk> <unk> , since it is usual to work in terms of half @ - @ sections where it <unk> .
The image &lt; unk &gt; of the <unk> and <unk> port of a section will generally not be the same .
However , for a mid @ - @ series section ( that is , a section from <unk> through a series element to <unk> through the next series element ) will have the same image &lt; unk &gt; on both ports due to <unk> .
This image &lt; unk &gt; is designated &lt; unk &gt; due to the &quot; T &quot; &lt; unk &gt; of a mid @ - @ series section .
Likewise , the image &lt; unk &gt; of a mid @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; section is designated &lt; unk &gt; due to the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> of such a &quot; T &quot; or &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; section is called a half @ - @ section , which is also an L @ - @ section but with half the element values of the full L @ - @ section .
The image &lt; unk &gt; of the half @ - @ section is &lt; unk &gt; on the <unk> and <unk> ports : on the side presenting the series element it is equal to the mid @ - @ series &lt; unk &gt; , but on the side presenting the &lt; unk &gt; element it is equal to the mid @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
There are thus two <unk> ways of using a half @ - @ section .
<unk> of this article or section <unk> on the <unk> &apos; s knowledge of the complex &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; and on knowledge of the frequency <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
= = &lt; unk &gt; = = The building block of constant k &lt; unk &gt; is the half @ - @ section &quot; L &quot; network , composed of a series &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; The &quot; k &quot; in &quot; constant k &quot; is the value given by , &lt; formula &gt; Thus , k will have units of &lt; unk &gt; , that is , &lt; unk &gt; .
It is <unk> apparent that in order for k to be constant , <unk> must be the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of <unk>
A physical interpretation of k can be given by <unk> that k is the <unk> value of &lt; unk &gt; as the size of the section ( in terms of values of its <unk> , such as &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> . )
approaches <unk> , while keeping k at its initial value .
Thus , k is the characteristic &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , of the transmission line that would be formed by these &lt; unk &gt; small sections .
It is also the image &lt; unk &gt; of the section at <unk> , in the case of band @ - @ pass &lt; unk &gt; , or at &lt; unk &gt; = 0 in the case of low @ - @ pass &lt; unk &gt; .
For example , the <unk> low @ - @ pass half @ - @ section has &lt; formula &gt; .
<unk> L and C can be made &lt; unk &gt; small while retaining the same value of k .
<unk> and <unk> however , are both approaching <unk> , and from the <unk> ( below ) for image &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; formula &gt; .
= = = <unk> &lt; unk &gt; = = = <unk> also <unk> &lt; unk &gt; # &lt; unk &gt; The image &lt; unk &gt; of the section are given by &lt; formula &gt; and &lt; formula &gt; <unk> that the filter does not contain any &lt; unk &gt; elements , the image &lt; unk &gt; in the pass band of the filter is <unk> real and in the stop band it is <unk> <unk> .
For example , for the <unk> low @ - @ pass half @ - @ section , &lt; formula &gt; The transition occurs at a cut @ - @ off frequency given by &lt; formula &gt; Below this frequency , the image &lt; unk &gt; is real , &lt; formula &gt; Above the cut @ - @ off frequency the image &lt; unk &gt; is <unk> , &lt; formula &gt; = = = &lt; unk &gt; <unk> = = = The transmission <unk> for a general constant k half @ - @ section are given by &lt; formula &gt; and for a <unk> of <unk> half @ - @ sections &lt; formula &gt; For the low @ - @ pass L @ - @ shape section , below the cut @ - @ off frequency , the transmission <unk> are given by &lt; formula &gt; That is , the transmission is &lt; unk &gt; in the pass @ - @ band with only the phase of the <unk> <unk> .
Above the cut @ - @ off frequency , the transmission <unk> are : &lt; formula &gt; = = = &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; = = = The presented <unk> of image &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and phase change <unk> to a low @ - @ pass prototype filter section .
The prototype has a cut @ - @ off frequency of &lt; unk &gt; = 1 &lt; unk &gt; / s and a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; k = 1 &lt; unk &gt; .
This is produced by a filter half @ - @ section with &lt; unk &gt; L = 1 &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; C = 1 &lt; unk &gt; .
This prototype can be &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and frequency <unk> to the <unk> values .
The low @ - @ pass prototype can also be transformed into high @ - @ pass , band @ - @ pass or band @ - @ stop types by <unk> of suitable frequency &lt; unk &gt; .
= = &lt; unk &gt; sections = = Several L @ - @ shape half @ - @ sections may be &lt; unk &gt; to form a <unk> filter .
Like &lt; unk &gt; must always face like in these <unk> .
There are therefore two <unk> that can be formed with two identical L @ - @ shaped half @ - @ sections .
Where a port of image &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> another &lt; unk &gt; , the section is called a &lt; unk &gt; section .
Where &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; the section so formed is a T section .
Further <unk> of half @ - @ sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or &lt; unk &gt; elements .
It should be <unk> in mind that the characteristics of the filter <unk> by the image method are only accurate if the section is <unk> with its image &lt; unk &gt; .
This is usually not true of the sections at either end , which are usually <unk> with a <unk> resistance .
The further the section is from the end of the filter , the more accurate the <unk> will become , since the effects of the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; are <unk> by the intervening sections .

It is the eighth Christmas special since the show &apos; s 2005 <unk> and the first to be within a series .
It was written by head writer and executive producer <unk> Moffat and directed by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
The episode is set in the Victorian era and sees the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) <unk> with the assistance of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ( <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ) , her wife Jenny Flint ( &lt; unk &gt; <unk> ) and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( Dan &lt; unk &gt; ) , after the loss of <unk> Amy <unk> and <unk> Williams in the previous episode , &quot; The <unk> Take Manhattan &quot; .

In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses <unk> &lt; unk &gt; as its physical presence .
The events of The <unk> of <unk> are <unk> to by the Doctor in &quot; The &lt; unk &gt; &quot; when he presents the London Underground &lt; unk &gt; tin to the Great Intelligence in Dr &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> ; the Intelligence states , &quot; I do not understand these <unk> &quot; , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin .
The Doctor remarks that the Underground is a &quot; key strategic weakness in <unk> living &quot; , referring to ( and possibly setting in motion ) the future &lt; unk &gt; attack on London via the Underground .
Coleman previously played &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in &quot; Asylum of the &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , though the connection between the two characters is not <unk> until &lt; unk &gt; reveals she has an interest in &lt; unk &gt; , a <unk> that &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s character also had .

= = Production = = = = = Writing and design changes = = = <unk> <unk> Moffat stated that he wanted an &quot; <unk> &quot; quality to the Christmas special .
The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his previous <unk> ; Moffat said that &quot; I think he &apos; s probably reached the point in his life where he &apos; s saying , &apos; <unk> for me is just postponed &lt; unk &gt; — I want to be on my own for a while &apos; . &quot;
Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen at the <unk> of the episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor ( William &lt; unk &gt; ) in 1963 and the &lt; unk &gt; Doctor ( Christopher <unk> ) in 2005 .
He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s , but rejected by the production team at the time .
<unk> the theme introduced with the series &apos; first five episodes , &quot; The &lt; unk &gt; &quot; was promoted like a movie .
A movie poster was released in the Radio Times , showing the Doctor and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> the ladder to the &lt; unk &gt; .
The episode saw several major design changes for the series . &quot;
The &lt; unk &gt; &quot; is the debut of a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; interior , as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme <unk> .
The new title sequence features a brief <unk> of the Doctor &apos; s face , the first time since <unk> , the final <unk> of the classic series in 1989 , that the Doctor &apos; s face has been seen in the title sequence .
Moffat had <unk> that the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; design was getting &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and <unk> more of a &quot; <unk> place &quot; rather than a machine .
It was designed by series production designer Michael &lt; unk &gt; , who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be &quot; <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; &quot; and provide an <unk> access to the &quot; <unk> &quot; of the ship when shooting .
The Doctor also wears a one @ - @ off costume , Victorian @ - @ <unk> , which Smith described as &quot; a bit &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; meets the Doctor &quot; .
Moffat described the new <unk> as a &quot; progression &quot; as the Doctor was in &quot; a different phase of his life now &quot; and felt more &quot; grown @ - @ up &quot; and &lt; unk &gt; .
The costume was designed by Howard &lt; unk &gt; for this episode . &quot;
The &lt; unk &gt; &quot; also contains several references to <unk> <unk> , including the Doctor <unk> up as him .
Moffat is co @ - @ <unk> of the BBC series <unk> , for which Smith <unk> for the role of Doctor Watson before being cast as the Doctor .
In addition , the <unk> music during the scene bears a <unk> to the <unk> theme .
= = = <unk> = = = This episode marks the return of <unk> @ - @ <unk> Coleman , who previously appeared in the series <unk> , &quot; Asylum of the &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
Coleman was cast because of her <unk> with Matt Smith , and especially because she was able to talk <unk> than him .
She <unk> for the role of &lt; unk &gt; , not &lt; unk &gt; from &quot; Asylum &quot; , as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to Moffat <unk> <unk> for &lt; unk &gt; .
The production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced <unk> keep Coleman &apos; s appearance a secret until &quot; Asylum &quot; was broadcast ; the effort was ultimately successful .
Moffat stated that the introduction of a new <unk> made &quot; the show feel different &quot; and brought the story to &quot; a new beginning &quot; with a different person meeting the Doctor .
Smith said that &lt; unk &gt; was different from her predecessor Amy <unk> ( <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ) , which allowed the audience to see a different side of the Doctor .
Coleman described her as <unk> and not <unk> , citing the reason for following the Doctor at the beginning as <unk> <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; who would become a <unk> <unk> of the Doctor would not debut until the Spring premiere , &quot; The <unk> of Saint John &quot; ; save for a brief <unk> at the end of &quot; The &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
Coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with &quot; <unk> that there would be a <unk> &quot; to her mystery .
Also returning to the series are <unk> &lt; unk &gt; as <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Dan &lt; unk &gt; as &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> as Jenny .
All three previously appeared in &quot; A Good Man <unk> to War &quot; and <unk> their roles both in this episode and in the &lt; unk &gt; .
They returned due to the popularity of &lt; unk &gt; and Jenny ; Moffat considered a <unk> @ - @ off featuring them , though he did not have the time to do it .
Instead , he decided to bring them back in the main series .
Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions , as an alternative <unk> Doctor in the <unk> charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , which was written by Moffat and as an alternative &lt; unk &gt; Doctor in the <unk> story <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; which had been intended to be a <unk> of the series before it was <unk> in 2005 .
Smith commented that Grant was &quot; born to be a Who <unk> .
He pitches it on that perfect level and tone &quot; .
Grant &apos; s appearance in Doctor Who was &lt; unk &gt; by the BBC via <unk> , <unk> his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012 .
<unk> Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script , and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme .
The Great Intelligence was <unk> by Sir <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
The two children &lt; unk &gt; is governess to , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , were played by real @ - @ life brother and sister Joseph and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ <unk> .
= = = <unk> and effects = = = &quot; The &lt; unk &gt; &quot; was originally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode Coleman shot as her character ; however , it did not begin filming until the week of 6 August 2012 , after Coleman had worked on later episodes while Moffat was writing the Christmas special .
The read @ - @ through had taken place on 2 August 2012 .
This was the first Christmas special to be filmed in BBC Wales &apos; new &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> .

Some scenes which used snow <unk> were filmed in Portland Square , <unk> , where filming took place <unk> on 21 – 22 August 2012 .

&lt; unk &gt; stated that his favourite set is the London Street with the back of the <unk> , which he said was based on a <unk> @ - @ century building in <unk> .
The locations were blocked off and &lt; unk &gt; with fake snow .
The &lt; unk &gt; on the cloud was achieved through a mix of fog on the studio floor and post @ - @ production special effects .
Director <unk> &lt; unk &gt; explained that it was difficult to achieve the <unk> look for the &lt; unk &gt; ; the first ones he <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; from <unk> which was too &quot; <unk> &quot; of an appearance , and so the effects team created more <unk> <unk> <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s introduction to the &lt; unk &gt; introduced two novel effects for the show .
The first was a single @ - @ shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the &lt; unk &gt; to its interior , with the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> @ - @ <unk> nature shown to the audience .
In the following shot , the camera does a complete circle of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , an effect not seen since the early days of the show .
&lt; unk &gt; wanted to include this shot to further <unk> the &quot; <unk> on the inside than the outside &quot; nature of the time machine .
In addition to the three <unk> <unk> @ - @ episodes , the cast also filmed an additional <unk> video , &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &quot; which the BBC <unk> during the days leading up to the broadcast .
The video featured &lt; unk &gt; singing modified versions of several Christmas songs in character as &lt; unk &gt; as his &lt; unk &gt; look on , before <unk> <unk> character and begins <unk> .

= Light Tank Mk VII &lt; unk &gt; = The Light Tank Mk VII ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , also known as the &lt; unk &gt; , was a British light tank produced by Vickers @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; in the late 1930s and deployed during the World War II .
The &lt; unk &gt; was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army .
It improved upon its predecessor , the Mk &lt; unk &gt; Light Tank , by <unk> the extra <unk> of a 2 @ - @ pounder gun .
The War Office ordered 70 tanks , an order that eventually increased to <unk> .
Production was delayed by several <unk> , and as a <unk> , only 100 to <unk> of the tanks were produced .
The tank &apos; s design <unk> , combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisions , ruled out the use of &lt; unk &gt; in the North African Campaign .
As a result , the majority of the tanks remained in Britain , although 20 were sent to the USSR as part of the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; program .
In early 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations , one of which was equipped with &lt; unk &gt; .
In May 1942 , a small number of &lt; unk &gt; formed part of the British force which participated in the invasion of Madagascar , and , in June 1942 , &lt; unk &gt; were attached to the 1st Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @ - @ <unk> light tank to support British airborne forces .
The &lt; unk &gt; were transported and landed in <unk> designed General <unk> &lt; unk &gt; gliders .
A lack of gliders prevented their <unk> in the Allied invasion of <unk> in 1943 ; instead they were attached to the new 6th Airborne Division and became part of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment .
The division used approximately 20 &lt; unk &gt; during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944 .
The tanks were successfully landed by glider , but they did not perform well .
Several were lost in <unk> , and those that did see action proved to be <unk> in <unk> and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces .
A few days after the beginning of the operation , the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support .
By August 1944 , most of the &lt; unk &gt; in action were replaced with <unk> cruiser tanks , and the remainder were replaced by the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in December 1944 .
&lt; unk &gt; did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946 ; the last was retired in 1950 .
There were several <unk> on the &lt; unk &gt; design , including the &lt; unk &gt; self @ - @ propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII , but none of these were ever used in active service with the British Army .
= = Development history = = = = = <unk> development = = = The prototype of the Light Tank Mk VII ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , <unk> &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; , was first developed in <unk> by Vickers @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; as a private <unk> , and was intended to be sold either to the British Army or to foreign <unk> .
It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company .
The tank was designed to <unk> the <unk> of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns .
Vickers @ - @ Armstrong installed on the Mk &lt; unk &gt; a 2 @ - @ pounder 40 @ - @ millimetre ( 1 @ .
@ 6 in ) main gun <unk> with a 7 @ .
@ 92 @ - @ millimetre ( 0 @ .
@ <unk> in ) &lt; unk &gt; machine gun , and mounted the two guns in a two @ - @ man turret .
The tank possessed a maximum of 14 <unk> ( 0 @ .
@ 55 in ) of armour .
The prototype weighed approximately 16 @ , @ 800 <unk> ( 7 @ , @ 600 kg ) and was powered by a 165 @ - @ <unk> ( <unk> kW ) <unk> engine .
&lt; unk &gt; was on eight road wheels , four per side , with no separate <unk> or &lt; unk &gt; wheels and it was capable of a 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) top speed .
The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a <unk> system incorporated into earlier Vickers models .
The front wheels could be <unk> to allow for <unk> turns by &lt; unk &gt; the tracks .
For <unk> turns , the system returned to the conventional method of &lt; unk &gt; one track to turn the tank ; the <unk> system of turning was designed to <unk> <unk> <unk> on the &lt; unk &gt; and reduce its power &lt; unk &gt; .
The <unk> system was also a new design that relied on <unk> with <unk> of air for &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; of oil for &lt; unk &gt; , and each of the wheels was independently <unk> .
The War Office <unk> the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938 ; the <unk> was tested as a possible &quot; light cruiser &quot; since War Office light tank <unk> were already met by its predecessor , the Mark VI .
The War Office then took the view that the tank was not <unk> as a light cruiser because the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; offered better speed and <unk> crossing performance .
Despite this , it was decided that it was essential for some &lt; unk &gt; to be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program .
Accordingly , the War Office gave the &lt; unk &gt; the official General Staff <unk> number &lt; unk &gt; , and , in November 1938 , accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the <unk> of an external fuel tank to increase the tank &apos; s range .
= = = Production = = = The number to be produced was subject to &lt; unk &gt; as the War Office &lt; unk &gt; in their <unk> ; in July 1938 , it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced , then increased the request to 120 after a three @ - @ day conference in November .
Production was to begin in July 1940 , but <unk> the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100 .
The number further increased to <unk> after Metropolitan &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; , a company part owned by Vickers @ - @ Armstrong that would be producing the tanks , indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks .
Production of the tank was delayed by a number of <unk> .
The War Office put their order on hold in a post @ - @ Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle .
Due to the <unk> of more suitable tanks , light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re @ - @ <unk> the <unk> of the light tank design .
The pre @ - @ war role of the light tank , that of reconnaissance , <unk> had been found to be better suited to <unk> cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @ - @ country <unk> .
Further <unk> were caused by the bombing raids of the <unk> during May 1941 against the <unk> where the tanks were assembled .
The <unk> effect of these <unk> resulted in the production of only a small number of Mk &lt; unk &gt; ; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and <unk> .
The name &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; was given to the Mk VII , on 22 September 1941 , on the orders of the War Office .
The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year .
= = = <unk> to airborne role = = = The War Office and the Army were <unk> , at this point , that light tanks were a <unk> and too vulnerable for use in further combat , and the &lt; unk &gt; was considered to be obsolete .
This decision may have marked the end for the &lt; unk &gt; in active service ; several of the tanks <unk> to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their <unk> systems were determined to be unable to <unk> with the intense North African heat .
The <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; was prevented by a decision made by the War Office in mid @ - @ 1941 , as it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain &apos; s <unk> airborne forces , formed in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister , <unk> Churchill .
When <unk> the equipment for the airborne forces , officials at the War Office concluded that gliders would be an <unk> component ; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment , which , by 1941 , was to include artillery and some form of tank .
Plans to transport a tank went through a number of <unk> , but , by May 1941 , the <unk> of a 5 @ .
@ 5 <unk> tons ( 5 @ .
@ 4 long tons ) tank to be carried for 350 miles ( <unk> km ) in a glider was accepted , although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task .
In a conference held on 16 January 1941 , it was decided that the General <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , currently under development , would be used to transport a single &lt; unk &gt; tank or two <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; was chosen because it was an obsolete design , and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces .
<unk> in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the &lt; unk &gt; and their crews inside &lt; unk &gt; gliders .
These exercises were successful ; during the training by &apos; C &apos; Squadron of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Regiment , which <unk> in flying the &lt; unk &gt; , over 2 @ , @ 800 &lt; unk &gt; were made with an average of 50 &lt; unk &gt; per crew .
Only three <unk> resulted in <unk> or injuries , with seven <unk> killed during the training .
When the &lt; unk &gt; was re @ - @ designated as an airborne tank , several changes were made to its design .
A number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a 76 @ .
@ 2 @ - @ millimetre ( 3 @ .
@ 00 in ) infantry support <unk> ; these tanks were then designated as &lt; unk &gt; 1 &lt; unk &gt; ( <unk> Support ) .
Additionally , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; were added to those &lt; unk &gt; which still possessed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration .
The &lt; unk &gt; experienced several <unk> throughout its development and <unk> with the Army and airborne forces .
One of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942 , which particularly affected the airborne forces .
The transport of 20 of the tanks to the USSR under the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Act <unk> the number available for use by airborne forces , as did the loss of several more during Operation &lt; unk &gt; , the invasion of Madagascar .
A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December 1942 stated that approximately 50 &lt; unk &gt; were available for use .
In a <unk> , dated January 1943 , by Major General George F. &lt; unk &gt; , commander of the 1st Airborne Division , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> that he had been <unk> that 70 of the tanks were available , whereas only 50 actually remained , with no reserves to replace those lost in combat .
This lack of sufficient replacement reserves , combined with a War Office report that some &lt; unk &gt; airborne tanks would be required for the 1st Airborne Division and an <unk> airborne division to be formed in India , led to the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s eventual replacement by the US &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
= = <unk> = = A number of design <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; were revealed through its operational use .
Its size limited the possible crew to three , a <unk> in the hull and a <unk> and commander in the turret , resulting in too few crew members to operate the &lt; unk &gt; effectively .
The <unk> or commander , in addition to his own duties , had to act as &lt; unk &gt; for the 2 pounder , which caused <unk> in combat .
A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank , controlling a troop of &lt; unk &gt; during combat would be almost impossible .
<unk> were also found with the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; fitted to the 2 @ - @ pounder to increase its range and penetration power ; after they had been fitted the &lt; unk &gt; could not be removed , and could only fire <unk> designed armour @ - @ piercing rounds , which took time to manufacture .
The War Office also considered the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> system <unk> , making the tank <unk> for service in &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , such as the Middle East and North Africa .
= = <unk> history = = = = = &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ <unk> = = = The first &lt; unk &gt; were delivered to the Army in November 1940 , and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division ( which was being <unk> after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the Battle of France ) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division .
However , the <unk> discovered with the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> system <unk> them from being <unk> into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign .
Shortly after , all light tanks were <unk> from the <unk> of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service .
The &lt; unk &gt; remained in Britain , and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service , but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR , Operation <unk> began , and the USSR became an <unk> of Britain .
The &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; program , begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China , was therefore extended to the USSR .
As part of the program , the British government began <unk> war materials to the USSR , which in early 1942 , included a <unk> of 20 &lt; unk &gt; , as well as a number of Valentine and <unk> Mk I Infantry tanks .
The Soviet military <unk> a greater number of light tanks than the British , and so could use the &lt; unk &gt; .
When the tanks arrived in the USSR , however , it was apparent that the design problems with the <unk> system were also present in cold conditions ; <unk> , the cold weather had a &lt; unk &gt; effect on the tank &apos; s <unk> and tracks .

The &lt; unk &gt; of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be <unk> , as the weight of extra armour plating caused an <unk> <unk> in the tank &apos; s speed .
Despite these <unk> in the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s design , Soviet authorities believed it to be <unk> to the T @ - @ 70 light tank in use at the time , and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat .
A number of &lt; unk &gt; were sent to Tank Training <unk> which were subsequently sent into battle , and in September 1943 two were assigned to the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Tank Battalion , which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade ; both tanks were destroyed in combat , one on 30 September and the other on 2 October , the latter a <unk> of artillery fire .
Several were also used for <unk> purposes , appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in the &lt; unk &gt; region .
= = = Operation &lt; unk &gt; = = = In mid @ - @ 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations , known as &apos; A &apos; , &apos; B &apos; and &apos; C &apos; Special Service Squadrons .
Both &apos; A &apos; and &apos; B &apos; Squadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark &lt; unk &gt; light tanks , but &apos; C &apos; Squadron was equipped with twelve &lt; unk &gt; transferred from the 2nd Armoured Brigade , 1st Armoured Division .
On 31 July 1941 , &apos; C &apos; Squadron was officially <unk> and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside &apos; A &apos; and &apos; B &apos; Squadrons in an <unk> tropical <unk> .

In early September , elements of &apos; C &apos; Squadron , including six &lt; unk &gt; , formed part of a force which sailed for <unk> in West Africa ; during this period of the war there were <unk> that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of Germany , and the force was &lt; unk &gt; to capture a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this occurred .
These <unk> proved &lt; unk &gt; , and in March 1942 , the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training .
The next assignment , Operation &lt; unk &gt; , was the invasion of Madagascar , the third largest island in the world and then under &lt; unk &gt; French control .
The Prime Minister and the <unk> <unk> of Staff decided that Madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to <unk> the port of &lt; unk &gt; to Japanese naval forces , which had recently advanced into the Indian Ocean .
Operation &lt; unk &gt; was under the command of Major General Robert <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and consisted of No .
5 <unk> , 29th Independent Brigade Group , and the 17th and 13th <unk> groups from 5th Infantry Division .
The 29th Brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations , and under its command was &apos; B &apos; Special Service Squadron , created by &lt; unk &gt; six &lt; unk &gt; from &apos; B &apos; Squadron and six &lt; unk &gt; from &apos; C &apos; Squadron into a single unit .
The squadron was formed into four troops , one Headquarters troop of three &lt; unk &gt; and one &lt; unk &gt; , one of four &lt; unk &gt; , and two formed from the remaining five &lt; unk &gt; .
The invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of Madagascar on 4 May , near &lt; unk &gt; and the <unk> of Diego &lt; unk &gt; .
The invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip , which would allow the British forces to advance approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) and approach &lt; unk &gt; from the rear .
<unk> about the landing beaches , the defences possessed by the port , and the &lt; unk &gt; French defending forces was limited and <unk> , although it was believed that the <unk> had no weapons capable of <unk> the armour of a Valentine tank .
The landings began at <unk> : 30 on 5 May , with 5 <unk> landing at &lt; unk &gt; Bay and the three infantry brigades and &apos; B &apos; Squadron landing at &lt; unk &gt; Bay .
The objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of &lt; unk &gt; and a nearby town , but although the infantry landed successfully , &apos; B &apos; Squadron had more trouble ; the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a &lt; unk &gt; came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the <unk> .
The infantry brigades advanced toward &lt; unk &gt; without the squadron , but eventually two &lt; unk &gt; and a single &lt; unk &gt; were dispatched in support , <unk> up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of &lt; unk &gt; .
Here the invasion force encountered the first French defences , consisting of <unk> <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; dug in along a ridge .
The tanks attempted to <unk> them , but the <unk> ground made &lt; unk &gt; difficult and they could not close with the &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> ; they engaged a number of targets with 2 pounder and machine @ - @ gun fire , but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day .
The tanks were ordered to <unk> the defences and advance further into the island , and they were soon joined by two other &lt; unk &gt; dispatched from the beaches ; the small force continued to advance until it encountered the &lt; unk &gt; French main line of defence .
This had been built prior to the First World War and included <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , machine @ - @ gun <unk> and dug @ - @ in 75 mm artillery pieces ; the latter , although not specifically designed for an anti @ - @ tank role , could penetrate the armour of both the &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; .
The two &lt; unk &gt; advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire , and two &lt; unk &gt; that were moving behind them suffered the same fate ; the third &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in order to report on the French resistance , machine &lt; unk &gt; a <unk> combination and a truck it encountered on the way back .
The commander of the &lt; unk &gt; made his report , and was then ordered to take command of four &lt; unk &gt; and two &lt; unk &gt; which had recently arrived and once again attempt to <unk> the French defences .
The tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out @ - @ flank the line by <unk> from the right @ - @ hand side , using several hills as cover ; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault , however , and one Valentine and one &lt; unk &gt; were hit and destroyed .
The remaining tanks exchanged several &lt; unk &gt; of fire with the artillery pieces before <unk> back to their original positions .
The French line was eventually broken by 29th Brigade , aided by an amphibious assault by Royal Marines ; the remaining tanks of &apos; B &apos; Squadron , two &lt; unk &gt; and three &lt; unk &gt; , remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 May , coming under <unk> artillery fire which disabled another Valentine .
The squadron played no further part in the battle , as the &lt; unk &gt; French authorities negotiated a formal <unk> the following day , although French troops would continue to engage the British occupying force in <unk> warfare until late November . &apos;
C &apos; Squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion ; only one Valentine and three &lt; unk &gt; out of twelve tanks were <unk> by 7 May , and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded .
It remained in Madagascar until early 1943 , when it was shipped to India and took part in the <unk> Campaign as part of 29th Brigade .
= = = Operation <unk> = = = Because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid @ - @ 1940 , when the British airborne establishment was formed , the War Office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops .
<unk> in setting up <unk> training facilities and <unk> suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne operation , Operation &lt; unk &gt; , was conducted by a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> unit .
By 1942 , there existed specifically trained airborne units , including the 1st Airborne Division , and on 19 January 1942 the War Office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division .
This unit , designated the Light Tank Squadron , was to be formed of <unk> light tanks and would operate to the <unk> of the division , using their tanks &apos; speed to capture <unk> and then holding them until <unk> by other units .
The obvious unit for conversion was &apos; C &apos; Special Services Squadron , as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and , more <unk> , was the only unit that was still using &lt; unk &gt; ; it had been re @ - @ designated as an airborne tank by the War Office . &apos;
C &apos; Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942 , bringing with it seven &lt; unk &gt; among its other vehicles .
The unit immediately began training , but was not attached to the 1st Airborne Division for long ; during mid @ - @ 1943 , the division was transported to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied invasion of <unk> . &apos;
C &apos; Squadron remained in Britain , as not enough &lt; unk &gt; gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its &lt; unk &gt; ; the squadron was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division , which had been raised in April 1943 , and &apos; C &apos; Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict .
The squadron continued to train as an air @ - @ <unk> unit , and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties , including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter @ - @ attacking enemy infantry and armour .
On 13 December 1943 , the War Office decided to <unk> the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as <unk> cars , and on 1 April 1944 , it was re @ - @ designated as the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment .
The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron , a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnaissance Squadron ; two &lt; unk &gt; , the Mark 1 &lt; unk &gt; variation , were attached to the Headquarters Squadron , but the Light Tank Squadron , also known as &apos; A &apos; Squadron , received the majority of the &lt; unk &gt; . &apos;
A &apos; Squadron had approximately <unk> &lt; unk &gt; split between six troops , two of which were of the &lt; unk &gt; variation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
On 24 May 1944 , after <unk> in a further series of exercises and <unk> , &apos; A &apos; Squadron moved from their training area to a <unk> camp at &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; airfield , while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF &lt; unk &gt; <unk> airfield the next day ; from these two <unk> , the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy .
The operation began on the night of 5 June , with the <unk> of 6th Airborne Division to eastern Normandy .
It was tasked with <unk> the eastern flank of the Allied &lt; unk &gt; landings , <unk> <unk> important areas east of <unk> , capturing several important bridges over the <unk> Canal and River &lt; unk &gt; , and destroying a coastal artillery battery .
&lt; unk &gt; transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division &apos; s brigades simultaneously ; one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day .
Major General Richard <unk> had initially intended for the 6th &lt; unk &gt; Brigade , to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached , to be landed first ; however , aerial photography revealed that anti @ - @ glider <unk> had been erected in the landing zone selected for the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade ( which did not &lt; unk &gt; gliders ) should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones , allowing the 6th &lt; unk &gt; Brigade to land in the second lift .
The &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; gliders of the <unk> landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of <unk> by the 5th Parachute Brigade .
The primary <unk> of the <unk> were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two <unk> brigades in <unk> the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to <unk> out German positions and <unk> the movement of German forces attempting to counter @ - @ attack .
The &lt; unk &gt; of &apos; A &apos; Squadron were to play an <unk> part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron &apos; s strength of twenty tanks was severely <unk> by the time it landed in Normandy .
It lost one tank before the formation landed when the &lt; unk &gt; broke loose of its &lt; unk &gt; and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @ - @ flight .
The squadron &apos; s strength was further weakened when two gliders <unk> with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the &lt; unk &gt; they carried ; a third &lt; unk &gt; hit another &lt; unk &gt; as it was being &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> the tank <unk> down , <unk> it <unk> , although the crew escaped without injury .
The surviving tanks were then <unk> temporarily <unk> when <unk> <unk> lines became <unk> in their &lt; unk &gt; , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
The squadron <unk> all of the remaining &lt; unk &gt; and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment ; there , they received orders to support the 8th Parachute Battalion in the &lt; unk &gt; de &lt; unk &gt; area and conduct reconnaissance duties .
After <unk> with the battalion , the squadron began &lt; unk &gt; , and engaged German infantry and armour they encountered .
By the end of 7 June , two &lt; unk &gt; had been lost to enemy action , one destroyed by a German self @ - @ propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine .
The division was reinforced by British troops who were <unk> from the invasion beaches and it began to push through Normandy , while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties .
At this time , <unk> decided to avoid , when possible , <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; with German armour , as they proved to be completely &lt; unk &gt; by the German tanks and self @ - @ propelled guns , such as the <unk> IV and the &lt; unk &gt; III .
Instead , when the division required armoured support , it <unk> it from armoured units outside the division , and the &lt; unk &gt; were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support .
By August , in the division &apos; s preparation for the planned <unk> from the Normandy <unk> , the majority of &lt; unk &gt; in &apos; A &apos; Squadron were replaced with <unk> fast cruiser tanks ; only three &lt; unk &gt; remained , assigned to the Headquarters troop of &apos; A &apos; Squadron .
= = = Post @ - @ war = = = Operation <unk> was the last that &lt; unk &gt; saw of active combat .
During the first week of October 1944 , the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive &lt; unk &gt; , in which it was completely &lt; unk &gt; , and all the remaining &lt; unk &gt; were retired .
They were replaced with the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , a purpose @ - @ built airborne light tank of American design ; eight &lt; unk &gt; were used by the regiment in March 1945 during Operation &lt; unk &gt; , the airborne operation to cross the river <unk> .
A report issued by the Director ( Air ) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the &lt; unk &gt; design was considered obsolete , and any light tanks used in post @ - @ war airborne <unk> would be entirely new in design .
A small number of &lt; unk &gt; remained in service with the 3rd <unk> until 1949 ; a &lt; unk &gt; glider flight was stationed at RAF &lt; unk &gt; , and a troop of &lt; unk &gt; was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders .
However , glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the &lt; unk &gt; withdrawn from service .
= = &lt; unk &gt; = = There were several <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; design .
The first was the Light Tank Mk VIII , Vickers @ - @ Armstrong &apos; s proposed successor to the &lt; unk &gt; .
The Mark VIII was also known as the Harry <unk> , named after President <unk> &apos; s chief diplomatic advisor , and was given the General Staff design number &lt; unk &gt; by the War Office .
The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of the &lt; unk &gt; in a number of areas .
It had <unk> armour than the &lt; unk &gt; , with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of 38 <unk> ( 1 @ .
@ 5 in ) and the side armour to 17 <unk> ( 0 @ .
@ 67 in ) , and the turret and hull given more <unk> <unk> to help &lt; unk &gt; shells fired at the tank .
The <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; were also changed ; the Mark VIII was longer by 6 inches ( 0 @ .
@ 15 m ) , wider by 1 foot 3 inches ( 0 @ .
@ 38 m ) and <unk> .
The new tank was no longer air @ - @ <unk> , as it was too heavy to be carried by a &lt; unk &gt; .
The 12 @ - @ <unk> engine of the &lt; unk &gt; was fitted to the Mark VIII , although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed <unk> to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) ; its armament also remained the same as that of the &lt; unk &gt; .
The War Office <unk> the construction of three prototype models in April 1941 .
The new design was considered a success , and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1 @ , @ 000 to be constructed in September .
However , problems were encountered with further <unk> of the <unk> , and a report issued in December 1942 stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to <unk> problems .
These problems continued to <unk> into 1943 , when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service ; approximately 100 Mark &lt; unk &gt; were produced by 1945 , when production ended .
A second <unk> on the &lt; unk &gt; design was the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Drive ( &quot; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; ) .
The &lt; unk &gt; Drive system was invented by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , and was designed to allow a tank to &apos; <unk> &apos; through water and participate in amphibious operations .
The system <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; a large &lt; unk &gt; canvas screen around the tank above its tracks , which was supported by thirty @ - @ six &lt; unk &gt; tubes and steel <unk> ; this gave the tank sufficient &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> , and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank &apos; s engine .
The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land .
The system was fitted during June 1941 , as the &lt; unk &gt; was the <unk> light tank available at the time ; the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of <unk> and <unk> , allowing the &lt; unk &gt; Drive system to be tested on <unk> tanks , such as the Valentine .
The system would be used during Operation &lt; unk &gt; , when <unk> <unk> medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches .

Of these , only the &lt; unk &gt; civilization developed in a <unk> tropical forest setting .
The &lt; unk &gt; were the first inhabitants of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities .
They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a <unk> style of stone sculpture .
In the first decade of the <unk> century evidence emerged of &lt; unk &gt; writing , with the earliest examples of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> dating to around <unk> BC .
<unk> of script have been found on <unk> <unk> and stone <unk> ; the <unk> are short and have been partially &lt; unk &gt; based on their <unk> to other &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The evidence of complex society developing in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; has led to the &lt; unk &gt; being regarded as the &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; of &lt; unk &gt; , although this concept remains <unk> .
Some of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; rulers seem to have served religious functions .
The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by La &lt; unk &gt; in about 900 BC , with &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; de los &lt; unk &gt; possibly <unk> the role ; other urban <unk> were much less significant .
The nature and degree of the control <unk> by the <unk> over a widespread rural population remains unclear .

Together with these , of particular <unk> to the colossal heads are the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ style <unk> &quot; in stone , so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the <unk> archaeological identification of an &lt; unk &gt; context .
These <unk> stone face <unk> present both <unk> and differences to the colossal heads .

However , the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900 BC , indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still .
The heads from &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; had been moved from their original context before they were <unk> by <unk> and the heads from La &lt; unk &gt; were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface .
The period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown , as is whether it <unk> a century or a <unk> .
<unk> of the time <unk> during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years .
The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest , and are the most &lt; unk &gt; executed .
All of the stone heads have been assigned to the &lt; unk &gt; period of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , generally to the Early &lt; unk &gt; ( <unk> – 1000 BC ) , although the two &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; heads and the La &lt; unk &gt; Head are attributed to the Middle &lt; unk &gt; ( 1000 – 400 BC ) .

All of the &lt; unk &gt; colossal heads depict mature men with flat &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed .
The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the &lt; unk &gt; region in modern times .
The backs of the heads are often flat , as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall .
All examples of &lt; unk &gt; colossal heads <unk> distinctive &lt; unk &gt; that probably represent <unk> or animal <unk> <unk> .
Some examples have a tied <unk> at the back of the head , and some are decorated with <unk> .
A head from La &lt; unk &gt; is decorated with the head of a bird .
There are <unk> between the &lt; unk &gt; on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific &lt; unk &gt; may represent different <unk> , or perhaps <unk> specific rulers .
Most of the heads <unk> large &lt; unk &gt; <unk> into the ear <unk> .
All of the heads are realistic , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of the men .
It is likely that they were portraits of living ( or recently deceased ) rulers well known to the &lt; unk &gt; .
Each head is distinct and &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; features .
They were once thought to represent &lt; unk &gt; although this theory is no longer widely held ; it is possible , however , that they represent rulers equipped for the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> depicted on the heads vary from stern through <unk> to <unk> .
The most &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; art is the earliest , appearing suddenly without surviving &lt; unk &gt; , with a <unk> towards more <unk> sculpture as time progressed .
Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El &lt; unk &gt; <unk> that the &lt; unk &gt; are likely to have created many more &lt; unk &gt; sculptures than works sculpted from stone .
In the late nineteenth century , José &lt; unk &gt; y <unk> described a colossal head as having &quot; <unk> &quot; features and speculations that the &lt; unk &gt; had African <unk> <unk> in 1960 in the work of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and in the 1970s in the writings of Ivan <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> speculation is not taken <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; scholars such as Richard &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar , there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution .
One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears <unk> of <unk> and red paint , suggesting that the heads were originally <unk> decorated .
<unk> did not just represent individual &lt; unk &gt; rulers ; they also incorporated the very concept of <unk> itself .
= = &lt; unk &gt; = = The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned , given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available ; it seems likely that only the more powerful &lt; unk &gt; rulers were able to &lt; unk &gt; such resources .
The <unk> would have included &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and other &lt; unk &gt; producing the <unk> to make and move the monument , in addition to the support needed to <unk> and <unk> attend to these workers .
The <unk> and agricultural <unk> and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end .
<unk> investigation of &lt; unk &gt; basalt <unk> suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct <unk> to <unk> away both large and small &lt; unk &gt; of stone .
The sculpture was then <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; the surface using &lt; unk &gt; , which were generally rounded &lt; unk &gt; that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case .
&lt; unk &gt; were found in <unk> with <unk> at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail .
&lt; unk &gt; colossal heads were <unk> as in @ - @ the @ - @ round monuments with <unk> levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure <unk> from a <unk> .
Its sides were broken away and it was <unk> to another location before being abandoned .
It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @ - @ <unk> the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed .
All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; were sculpted from basalt mined in the <unk> de los &lt; unk &gt; mountains of Veracruz .
Most were formed from <unk> &lt; unk &gt; dark <unk> basalt known as &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; basalt after a <unk> in the range .
&lt; unk &gt; have proposed that large &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments .
These boulders are found in an area affected by large &lt; unk &gt; ( <unk> <unk> ) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes , which suggests that the &lt; unk &gt; did not need to <unk> the <unk> material for &lt; unk &gt; the heads .
<unk> <unk> boulders were carefully selected to <unk> the shape of a human head .
The stone for the San Lorenzo and La &lt; unk &gt; heads was transported a considerable distance from the source .
The La &lt; unk &gt; head was found on El &lt; unk &gt; hill in the <unk> de los &lt; unk &gt; and the stone from &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Head 1 and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Head 1 ( also known as &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> A and Q ) came from the same hill .
The boulders were transported over 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from the source of the stone .
The exact method of transportation of such large <unk> of rock are unknown , especially since the &lt; unk &gt; lacked &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> and <unk> wheels , and they were likely to have used water transport <unk> possible .
Coastal <unk> of the Gulf of Mexico and in river <unk> might have made the &lt; unk &gt; transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more <unk> .
Two badly damaged &lt; unk &gt; sculptures depict <unk> stone blocks <unk> with <unk> .
A largely destroyed human figure <unk> upon each block , with their <unk> <unk> over the side .
These sculptures may well depict &lt; unk &gt; rulers <unk> the transport of the stone that would be <unk> into their monuments .
When transport over land was necessary , the &lt; unk &gt; are likely to have used &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> and roads to <unk> moving the heads .

Only four of the seventeen &lt; unk &gt; heads do not have flattened backs , indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments .

The two &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site .
The discovery of one of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; culture , carried out by Matthew &lt; unk &gt; in 1938 .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Monument A ( also known as &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Head 1 ) was the first colossal head to be found , discovered by accident in the middle of the nineteenth century , 1 <unk> ( 0 @ .

Its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the 1940s , when it was struck by <unk> being used to clear vegetation from &lt; unk &gt; hill .
Monument Q was the <unk> colossal head to be discovered .
It was moved to the plaza of Santiago &lt; unk &gt; in 1951 and remains there to this day .
Monument Q was first described by Williams and &lt; unk &gt; in an article published in 1965 .
The headdress is decorated with a frontal <unk> @ - @ shaped <unk> , and the back of the head is sculpted with seven &lt; unk &gt; of hair <unk> with &lt; unk &gt; .

It was discovered in a mountain pass in the <unk> de los &lt; unk &gt; , on the north side of El &lt; unk &gt; <unk> near to Santiago &lt; unk &gt; .
The head was largely buried when found ; <unk> <unk> a Late Classic ( 600 – 900 AD ) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a 12 @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ( 4 @ .

This massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons .
It is &lt; unk &gt; distinct from the other examples , and &lt; unk &gt; de la &lt; unk &gt; placed it late in the &lt; unk &gt; time frame .
The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some <unk> suggesting that it represents a deceased person .

The eyes of the monument are closed , the nose is flattened and <unk> <unk> and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner .
The headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band .
The original location of the La &lt; unk &gt; head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination .
Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished , such as a lack of <unk> below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base .
Rock was not removed from around the &lt; unk &gt; as on other heads , and does not narrow towards the base .
<unk> parts of the monument seem to be &lt; unk &gt; out without finished detail .
The right hand &lt; unk &gt; also appears incomplete ; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief , probably indicating that the right <unk> and eye area were also unfinished .

In April 2016 , Brad Stevens led the Celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance under his <unk> as the 5th seed in the 2016 NBA &lt; unk &gt; finishing the season with a 48 – 34 record .
On June 1 , 2016 , Stevens received a contract extension .
= = <unk> style = = According to Stevens , in one of his first games as head coach , he was <unk> and &quot; felt like our team played on edge &quot; because of it .
He decided that a team &apos; s play will reflect the mood of its coach ; a calm coach means a team that will remain <unk> in difficult game <unk> , while a <unk> coach means a team that plays on edge . &quot;
I don ’ t want to <unk> a game because of my approach , &quot; he told himself .
Accordingly , he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games .
He rarely <unk> his voice or gets emotional , instead <unk> <unk> on the &lt; unk &gt; with folded arms .
He does not get upset about bad calls by &lt; unk &gt; or player <unk> , <unk> to focus on &quot; the next play &quot; rather than what just happened .
Butler player Willie &lt; unk &gt; explained Butler &apos; s 2010 Final Four run by saying , &quot; When those big runs &#91; by Syracuse and Kansas State &#93; came , Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words .
Then he said he believes in us , he <unk> us and we &apos; re going to win the game . &quot;
On the <unk> <unk> Stevens feels the need to <unk> a player , he does it with &quot; positive <unk> , just at a little <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves .
Above all , Stevens wants his players to be <unk> , not living in fear of being &lt; unk &gt; for making a bad play .
&lt; unk &gt; , Stevens is always calm , but <unk> he is far from it . &quot;
I &apos; m not as calm as <unk> thinks , &quot; Stevens says .
His wife Tracy <unk> , &quot; He ’ s calm and collected , but he ’ s <unk> competitive .
He ’ s always thinking about how he can beat you . &quot;
<unk> player <unk> &lt; unk &gt; says &quot; <unk> sees Brad as a level @ - @ headed , calm and cool coach , but he ’ s about as competitive of a <unk> as I know .
We would get into it constantly , whether playing two @ - @ on @ - @ two or arguing about players ’ having better college <unk> . &quot;
Stevens <unk> a lot of time <unk> for each game , and always tries to add a few new &lt; unk &gt; specific to that game &apos; s opponent .
Sports <unk> calls Stevens an <unk> &quot; on breaking down <unk> and looking at statistical <unk> to find opponents &apos; <unk> . &quot;
<unk> player <unk> &lt; unk &gt; agrees : &quot; We know everything we need to about our opponents , all their <unk> are broken down &quot; ahead of time .
Stevens is a <unk> of using statistical analysis to <unk> his coaching decisions , spending almost as much time looking at <unk> as watching game film . &quot;
I think it &apos; s a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best <unk> to your players &quot; , he <unk> .
For example , when Butler was &lt; unk &gt; in late 2010 , Stevens challenged his team : &quot; this &#91; 46 % defensive field goal percentage &#93; is where we are .
This <unk> &apos; t <unk> to get to where we want to go .
But what does that really mean ?
It &apos; s not just get better &lt; unk &gt; , it is , if we give up 3 less &lt; unk &gt; a game , then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country &quot; .
The team got the <unk> , improved throughout the season , and ultimately went on a March run <unk> by defense .
In 2012 , Stevens became the first college coach to <unk> someone solely for statistical <unk> when he added <unk> <unk> to the staff .
If he had the resources , Stevens says he would <unk> a team of &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> the teams play .
Stevens &apos; teams are built around solid basketball &lt; unk &gt; and good team work , rather than individual basketball <unk> .
His teams are known for their defense , forcing opponents into &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The secret to basketball – and life – is &quot; just to do the job to the best of your ability and don &apos; t <unk> about anything else , &quot; Stevens says . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; the next game .
&lt; unk &gt; the next possession .
That &apos; s our focus .
It &apos; s boring .
It &apos; s also the way championships are won &quot; , he says .
In short , Stevens is a strong <unk> in &quot; The Butler Way &quot; – doing all the little things that <unk> a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team . &quot;
I tell the players &apos; the Butler Way &apos; <unk> &apos; t easy to define , &quot; Stevens says , &quot; but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball , play with great energy and defend . &quot;
Stevens <unk> to <unk> strong team players instead of going after &quot; top <unk> . &quot;
&quot; The <unk> we &#91; have &#93; recruited , most of them <unk> &apos; t very highly ranked , &quot; Stevens says . &quot;
They had very good high school <unk> or <unk> at other places ( <unk> ) , but for one reason or the other they <unk> &apos; t seen as great players .
But they all had &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
Stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only <unk> a &quot; one and done &quot; player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing <unk> .
Stevens has often been referred to as a coaching &lt; unk &gt; , but is not interested in self @ - @ promotion .
He instead <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> he <unk> to the players , <unk> department , and his &lt; unk &gt; .
He has not been known to <unk> for more money , or to <unk> his name for open coaching positions .
He has been described as <unk> , <unk> , and not &quot; about the money &quot; .
The New York Times , USA Today , <unk> , and other <unk> have attributed Butler &apos; s success against teams with superior athletes to Stevens &apos; coaching style .
The Times remarks , &quot; the Bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents , and they do not &lt; unk &gt; easily &quot; , and says that the resulting <unk> has led to the team &apos; s success . &quot;
He <unk> to his <unk> and to his <unk> , &quot; &lt; unk &gt; says . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; , he has great &lt; unk &gt; and communication ability with his team . &quot;

From the Earth , it is viewed edge @ - @ on in a region of rough , &lt; unk &gt; terrain .
It is located within the South Pole @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; basin on a &lt; unk &gt; .

No significant craters <unk> the rim , and it is <unk> about 1 @ .
@ 5 ° toward the direction 50 – 90 ° from the Earth .
The age of the crater is about 3 @ .
@ 6 billion years and it has been in the <unk> of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years .
Because the <unk> of the Moon is &lt; unk &gt; only 5 ° from the <unk> , the interior of this crater lies in <unk> darkness .

&lt; unk &gt; along the rim of the crater are almost <unk> <unk> by sunlight , spending about 80 – 90 % of each lunar <unk> exposed to the <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> mountains have been <unk> <unk> of <unk> light and have been <unk> to exist since the <unk> .
The <unk> portion of the crater was &lt; unk &gt; with the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of the Japanese &lt; unk &gt; spacecraft using the <unk> of sunlight <unk> off the rim .
The interior of the crater consists of a <unk> 30 ° <unk> that leads down to a 6 @ .

The handful of craters along the interior <unk> no more than a few hundred meters .
The bottom is covered by an <unk> <unk> @ - @ like feature that is 300 to 400 m thick .
The central peak is about 200 m in height .
The continuous <unk> in the south polar craters cause the <unk> of these <unk> to maintain a temperature that never <unk> about 100 <unk> For &lt; unk &gt; , the average temperature was determined to be about 90 K , reaching <unk> K at the crater floor .
Under these conditions , the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10 − 26 to 10 − 27 m / s .

However , the surface <unk> of the crater floor matches the lunar far @ - @ side , suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice .
This crater was named after Ernest Henry &lt; unk &gt; , an <unk> @ - @ Irish <unk> of <unk> from <unk> until his death in <unk> .
The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1994 .

&lt; unk &gt; lies entirely within the rim of the <unk> South Pole @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; basin , which is one of the largest known impact <unk> in the <unk> System .
This basin is over 12 kilometers deep , and an <unk> of its properties could provide <unk> information about the lunar interior .
A <unk> &lt; unk &gt; on board the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; spacecraft <unk> enhanced <unk> of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar <unk> , including the crater &lt; unk &gt; .
At the end of this mission in July 1999 , the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> from Earth @ - @ based <unk> an impact @ - @ generated <unk> containing water <unk> .
The impact event did not produce any <unk> water <unk> , and this may be an <unk> that the hydrogen is not in the form of <unk> <unk> , or that the impact site did not contain any ice .
<unk> , it is possible that the crash did not <unk> <unk> enough into the &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> significant <unk> of water <unk> .
From Earth @ - @ based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge , &lt; unk &gt; appears to be relatively <unk> ; much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent <unk> .
This may mean that the inner sides are relatively <unk> , which may make <unk> the sides relatively difficult for a <unk> vehicle .
In addition , it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; since its formation .
However other craters in the vicinity are <unk> older , and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen , possibly in the form of water ice .
( <unk> <unk> ( lunar crater ) , for example . )
<unk> studies preceding and following the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; mission <unk> that the inner walls of &lt; unk &gt; are similar in <unk> characteristics to those of some &lt; unk &gt; craters .
In particular , the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface &lt; unk &gt; , and not ice deposits , as was previously suggested from a radar <unk> involving the &lt; unk &gt; mission .
This interpretation , however , is not <unk> agreed upon within the <unk> community .
<unk> images of the crater at a <unk> of 13 cm show no evidence for water ice deposits .
<unk> <unk> inside the crater was done for the first time by the Japanese lunar &lt; unk &gt; spacecraft &lt; unk &gt; in 2007 .
It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice , down to the image resolution of 10 m per <unk> .
On November 15 , 2008 , a 34 @ - @ kg <unk> made a hard landing near the crater .
The <unk> impact <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) was launched from the Indian &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ I spacecraft and reached the surface 25 minutes later .
The <unk> carried a radar &lt; unk &gt; , video <unk> system , and a mass &lt; unk &gt; , which will be used to search for water .
= = <unk> uses = = Some sites along &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s rim <unk> almost constant <unk> .
At these &lt; unk &gt; sunlight is almost always available for conversion into <unk> using <unk> panels , potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings .
The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more <unk> <unk> as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100 ° C when the <unk> is overhead , to as low as − 150 ° C during the lunar night .
While <unk> <unk> performed by &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters , the current evidence is far from <unk> .
There are <unk> among <unk> as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice , as well as to the <unk> of this &quot; <unk> &quot; with depth below the surface .
<unk> of this issue will require future missions to the Moon .
The presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be &quot; mined &quot; for deposits of hydrogen in water form , a <unk> that is <unk> to deliver directly from the Earth .
This crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared <unk> .
The low temperature of the crater floor makes it <unk> for infrared <unk> , and <unk> <unk> placed along the rim could provide near @ - @ continuous power to the <unk> .
About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5 @ - @ km tall &lt; unk &gt; Mountain , a peak that is &lt; unk &gt; visible from the Earth , and which could serve as a radio <unk> station when <unk> equipped .
<unk> has named the rim of &lt; unk &gt; as a potential candidate for its lunar <unk> , <unk> to be up and running by &lt; unk &gt; and continuously <unk> by a crew by &lt; unk &gt; .
The location would promote self @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; for lunar residents , as <unk> sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for <unk> panels .
Furthermore , the <unk> polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human <unk> and could also be <unk> for fuel manufacture .

<unk> by many as about &quot; the meaning of life &quot; or &quot; the <unk> existence of the American <unk> &quot; , the film has <unk> <unk> by even the <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; is &lt; unk &gt; , saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it : &quot; a mystery story , a &lt; unk &gt; journey through American &lt; unk &gt; , a series of love stories ; &#91; ... &#93; it was about <unk> , &#91; ... &#93; <unk> , &#91; and &#93; beauty .
It was <unk> ; it was angry , <unk> . &quot;
The literary critic and author <unk> C. &lt; unk &gt; concludes that the film &lt; unk &gt; any one interpretation : &quot; &#91; American Beauty &#93; cannot be <unk> summarized as &apos; here is a <unk> on what &apos; s <unk> with American life &apos; ; that plays down the celebration of beauty .
It is more <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; it as &apos; a portrait of the beauty <unk> American &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &apos; , but that plays down the scenes of <unk> and <unk> , and Ball &apos; s <unk> with our &lt; unk &gt; .
It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky &apos; s <unk> <unk> about what life is or how one should live . &quot;
He argues that the problem of <unk> the film is tied with that of finding its center — a controlling voice who &quot; &#91; &lt; unk &gt; &#93; all of the choices &quot; .
He <unk> that in American Beauty &apos; s case , it is neither &lt; unk &gt; nor Ball .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> the voice to be Ball &apos; s , but even while the writer was &quot; strongly influential &quot; on set , he often had to accept <unk> from his vision , particularly ones that transformed the <unk> tone of his script into something more <unk> .
With &quot; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; on the original author &apos; s , &quot; &lt; unk &gt; says , those who <unk> American Beauty &quot; have <unk> to <unk> for the <unk> center &quot; .
According to &lt; unk &gt; , the film &apos; s true <unk> is the creative energy &quot; that hundreds of people put into its production , <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> and <unk> &quot; .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; and redemption = = = &lt; unk &gt; called American Beauty a <unk> of passage film about <unk> and escape from <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; of Lester &apos; s existence is established through his <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; clothing .
In these scenes , he is often <unk> as if trapped , &quot; <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> him &quot; .
He &lt; unk &gt; in the &lt; unk &gt; of his <unk> ; the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and the shot is the first of many where Lester is <unk> behind <unk> or within <unk> , such as when he is <unk> behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor , &quot; <unk> &#91; and &#93; nearly crossed out &quot; .
The academic and author &lt; unk &gt; W. &lt; unk &gt; argues that Lester &apos; s journey is the story &apos; s center .
His sexual &lt; unk &gt; through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to &quot; &#91; throw &#93; off the responsibilities of the <unk> life he has come to &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
After Lester shares a joint with Ricky , his <unk> is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn .
<unk> by Ricky &apos; s &quot; attractive , <unk> <unk> &quot; , Lester is convinced that Angela is &lt; unk &gt; and sees that he must question his &quot; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> existence &quot; ; he takes a job at a fast @ - @ food <unk> , which allows him to &lt; unk &gt; to a point when he could &quot; see his whole life ahead of him &quot; .
When Lester is caught &lt; unk &gt; by Carolyn , his angry &lt; unk &gt; about their lack of <unk> is the first time he says <unk> what he thinks about her .
By &lt; unk &gt; the issue and Carolyn &apos; s &quot; <unk> <unk> in others &quot; , Lester is trying to &quot; <unk> a voice in a home that &#91; only <unk> &#93; the <unk> of mother and daughter &quot; .
His final turning point comes when Angela and he almost have sex ; after she <unk> her &lt; unk &gt; , he no longer thinks of her as a sex <unk> , but as a daughter .
He holds her close and &quot; &lt; unk &gt; her up &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; called it &quot; the most <unk> end to &#91; Lester &apos; s &#93; journey there could possibly have been &quot; .
With these final scenes , &lt; unk &gt; intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; .
After Lester gets a <unk> from the &lt; unk &gt; , the camera <unk> toward him , then stops facing a &lt; unk &gt; down which he walks &quot; to meet his fate &quot; .
<unk> begun to act his age again , Lester <unk> <unk> .
As he &lt; unk &gt; at a family <unk> , the camera <unk> slowly from Lester to the <unk> wall , onto which blood &lt; unk &gt; as a <unk> <unk> out ; the slow <unk> <unk> the peace of Lester &apos; s death .
His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky .
&lt; unk &gt; said that Ricky &apos; s <unk> into Lester &apos; s dead eyes is &quot; the <unk> of the theme &quot; of the film : that beauty is found where it is least expected .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; and beauty = = = Like other American films of 1999 — such as Fight Club , <unk> Out the Dead , and <unk> , American Beauty <unk> its audience to &quot; &#91; lead &#93; more <unk> lives &quot; .
The film argues the case against <unk> , but does not <unk> that people need and want it ; even the gay characters just want to fit in .
Jim and Jim , the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; other neighbors , are a <unk> of &quot; gay &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , who &quot; &#91; <unk> &#93; in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; that the film <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The feminist academic and author &lt; unk &gt; R. &lt; unk &gt; argues that American Beauty uses its &quot; art house &quot; &lt; unk &gt; to direct its <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; primarily to the middle <unk> , and that this approach is a &quot; <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> ; &#91; ... &#93; the <unk> <unk> being that the <unk> of finding an individual &apos; self &apos; through <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; is always open to those wealthy enough to <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; enough to present themselves &lt; unk &gt; as a rebel . &quot;
<unk> <unk> M. &lt; unk &gt; argues that the film &apos; s <unk> center is its direction to the audience to &quot; look closer &quot; .
The opening <unk> an <unk> <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; neighborhood with Lester &apos; s <unk> <unk> that he will soon die , forcing audiences to consider their own <unk> and the beauty around them .
It also <unk> a series of <unk> ; &lt; unk &gt; asks , &quot; from what place <unk> , and from what state of being , is he telling this story ?
If he &apos; s already dead , why &lt; unk &gt; with <unk> it is he <unk> to tell about his last year of being alive ?
There is also the question of how Lester has died — or will die . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; believes the preceding scene — Jane &apos; s discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father — <unk> further mystery .
<unk> <unk> C. Hall &lt; unk &gt; ; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery , the film allows the audience to put it aside &quot; to view the film and its <unk> issues &quot; .
Through this <unk> of Lester &apos; s life , &lt; unk &gt; and death , American Beauty &lt; unk &gt; American middle class <unk> of meaning , beauty and <unk> .
Even Lester &apos; s transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela ; he therefore remains a &quot; willing <unk> of the popular media &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; male <unk> as a <unk> route to personal &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of <unk> ; from her belief in &quot; house beautiful &quot; domestic &lt; unk &gt; to her car and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , Carolyn &apos; s <unk> is a &quot; &lt; unk &gt; American &lt; unk &gt; vision of &lt; unk &gt; , or <unk> &quot; .
The &lt; unk &gt; are <unk> that they are &quot; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &quot; who expect the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; of American beauty &quot; to give them <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; argues that &quot; they are <unk> in the face of the &lt; unk &gt; economic and sexual <unk> &#91; ... &#93; that they and their culture have designated for their <unk> . &quot;
The film presents Ricky as its &quot; <unk> , &#91; ... &#93; <unk> and <unk> center &quot; .
He sees beauty in the &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> life , &lt; unk &gt; as much as he can for fear of missing it .
He shows Jane what he <unk> the most beautiful thing he has filmed : a plastic bag , &lt; unk &gt; in the wind in front of a wall .
He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was &quot; an entire life behind things &quot; ; he feels that &quot; sometimes there &apos; s so much beauty in the world I feel like I can &apos; t take it ... and my heart is going to <unk> in . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; argues that Ricky , in looking past the &quot; cultural &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , has &quot; &#91; <unk> &#93; the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of the created world &quot; to see God .
As the film <unk> , the &lt; unk &gt; move closer to Ricky &apos; s view of the world .
Lester only &lt; unk &gt; personal <unk> at the film &apos; s end .
On the &lt; unk &gt; of having sex with Angela , he returns to himself after she <unk> her &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> <unk> with a child , he begins to <unk> her as a daughter ; in doing so , Lester sees himself , Angela , and his family &quot; for the poor and <unk> but &lt; unk &gt; <unk> they are &quot; .
He looks at a picture of his family in &lt; unk &gt; times , and <unk> having had an &lt; unk &gt; that &lt; unk &gt; him with &quot; <unk> , <unk> , and soul @ - @ <unk> <unk> &quot; — he has finally seen the world as it is .
According to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , colors are used <unk> throughout the film , none more so than red , which is an important <unk> signature that <unk> the story and &quot; &#91; <unk> &#93; Lester &apos; s arc &quot; .
First seen in <unk> colors that reflect his &lt; unk &gt; , Lester <unk> himself with red as he &lt; unk &gt; his <unk> .
The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as <unk> ; when Lester &lt; unk &gt; about Angela , she is usually <unk> and surrounded by rose &lt; unk &gt; .
In these scenes , the rose &lt; unk &gt; Lester &apos; s desire for her .
When associated with Carolyn , the rose represents a &quot; <unk> for <unk> success &quot; .
<unk> are included in almost every shot inside the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; home , where they <unk> &quot; a <unk> covering a <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; reality &quot; .
Carolyn feels that &quot; as long as there can be &lt; unk &gt; , all is well &quot; .
She <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; and puts them in &lt; unk &gt; , where they <unk> her &quot; &lt; unk &gt; vision of what makes for beauty &quot; and begin to die .
The &lt; unk &gt; in the <unk> in the Angela – Lester <unk> scene <unk> Lester &apos; s previous life and Carolyn ; the camera <unk> in as Lester and Angela get closer , finally taking the &lt; unk &gt; — and thus Carolyn — out of the shot .
Lester &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red , building to a <unk> that is a <unk> contrast to the release Lester feels .
The constant use of red &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &#91; the audience &#93; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; into becoming used to it ; <unk> , it leaves the audience <unk> when Lester is shot and his blood &lt; unk &gt; on the wall .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; and repression = = = &lt; unk &gt; argues that American Beauty <unk> its characters through their <unk> .
Lester &apos; s attempts to <unk> his youth are a direct result of his <unk> for Angela , and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact .
Also <unk> <unk> , Carolyn has an affair that takes her from &quot; cold &lt; unk &gt; &quot; to a more &lt; unk &gt; soul who &quot; &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> along with &quot; the music in her car .
Jane and Angela constantly reference sex , through Angela &apos; s <unk> of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls <unk> each other .
Their <unk> scenes are used to <unk> their vulnerability .
By the end of the film , Angela &apos; s hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester &apos; s <unk> to her .
Col. &lt; unk &gt; <unk> with <unk> to meeting Jim and Jim ; he asks , &quot; How come these <unk> always have to <unk> it in your face ?
How can they be so &lt; unk &gt; ? &quot;
To which Ricky <unk> , &quot; That &apos; s the thing , <unk> — they don &apos; t feel like it &apos; s anything to be &lt; unk &gt; of . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; argues that Col. &lt; unk &gt; &apos; reaction is not &lt; unk &gt; , but an &quot; &lt; unk &gt; self @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
With other turn @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ <unk> films such as Fight Club , In the Company of <unk> ( 1997 ) , American &lt; unk &gt; ( 2000 ) , and Boys Don &apos; t &lt; unk &gt; ( 1999 ) , American Beauty &quot; <unk> the <unk> , widely <unk> issue of &lt; unk &gt; in crisis &quot; .
<unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; charges that in their <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; &quot; against <unk> <unk> by war , by &lt; unk &gt; , and by feminist and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; , these films present a need to &quot; focus on , and even to <unk> &quot; aspects of &lt; unk &gt; &quot; deemed &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; &quot; .
Lester &apos; s transformation <unk> &quot; that he , and not the woman , has <unk> the <unk> of &#91; lack of being &#93; &quot; and he will not stand for being &lt; unk &gt; .
Lester &apos; s attempts to &quot; strengthen traditional &lt; unk &gt; &quot; conflict with his responsibilities as a father .
Although the film <unk> the way Lester returns to that role <unk> , he does not become &quot; the &lt; unk &gt; figure <unk> celebrated in films like Fight Club &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; concludes that Lester &apos; s <unk> toward Angela is &quot; a &lt; unk &gt; but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; says the film &quot; <unk> <unk> the importance of <unk> the <unk> against &lt; unk &gt; &quot; ; a recurring theme of Ball &apos; s work is his comparison of the &lt; unk &gt; against &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> .
Instead of making an <unk> <unk> , American Beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence .
Col. &lt; unk &gt; is so &lt; unk &gt; of his <unk> that it <unk> him to murder Lester .
Ball said , &quot; The movie is in part about how <unk> is based in fear and repression and about what &#91; they &#93; can do . &quot;
The film <unk> two &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> : Lester &apos; s <unk> of Angela is a <unk> of his <unk> for his own daughter , while Col. &lt; unk &gt; &apos; repression is exhibited through the almost &lt; unk &gt; <unk> with which he controls Ricky .
Consequently , Ricky <unk> that he can only <unk> his father by <unk> telling him he is homosexual , while Angela &apos; s vulnerability and submission to Lester <unk> him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy .
Col. &lt; unk &gt; represents Ball &apos; s father , whose &lt; unk &gt; homosexual <unk> led to his own &lt; unk &gt; .
Ball <unk> Col. &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> revealing him as homosexual , which &lt; unk &gt; <unk> as a possible &quot; &lt; unk &gt; of Ball &apos; s own <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; and music = = = American Beauty follows a traditional <unk> structure , only &lt; unk &gt; with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story .
Although the plot <unk> one year , the film is <unk> by Lester at the moment of his death .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; says that the plot &quot; <unk> &#91; ... &#93; no time &#91; or &#93; all time &quot; , citing Lester &apos; s claim that life did not <unk> before his eyes , but that it &quot; <unk> on <unk> like an ocean of time &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; argues that a &quot; rhythm of <unk> &quot; forms the core of the film &apos; s structure .
For example , two scenes have the &lt; unk &gt; sitting down to an evening <unk> , shot from the same angle .
Each image is broadly similar , with minor differences in <unk> placement and body language that reflect the changed <unk> brought on by Lester &apos; s new @ - @ found <unk> .
Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other .
Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she <unk> her <unk> , and the image is reversed later for a similarly &quot; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &quot; scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment .
Lester &apos; s <unk> are <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> @ - @ motion shots ; &lt; unk &gt; uses double @ - @ and @ - @ triple &lt; unk &gt; in several sequences , and the score <unk> to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy .
One example is the &lt; unk &gt; scene — Lester &apos; s first encounter with Angela .
While the &lt; unk &gt; perform their half @ - @ time <unk> to &quot; On Broadway &quot; , Lester becomes increasingly &lt; unk &gt; on Angela .
Time <unk> to represent his &quot; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; and Lester begins to &lt; unk &gt; that Angela &apos; s performance is for him alone . &quot;
On Broadway &quot; — which provides a conventional &lt; unk &gt; to the &lt; unk &gt; action — is replaced by <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; music that <unk> melody or progression .
This &lt; unk &gt; score is important to creating the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in the sequence ; it <unk> a moment for Lester that is <unk> to an <unk> length .
The effect is one that <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; to &quot; <unk> time &quot; , described by the <unk> and music <unk> <unk> <unk> as music that &lt; unk &gt; &quot; a single present <unk> out into an <unk> <unk> , a potentially <unk> &apos; now &apos; that nonetheless feels like an <unk> &quot; .
The music is used like a visual <unk> , so that Lester and the score are <unk> at Angela .
The sequence ends with the <unk> <unk> of &quot; On Broadway &quot; and &lt; unk &gt; time .
According to <unk> Miller of &lt; unk &gt; , the soundtrack &quot; &#91; gives &#93; <unk> voice &quot; to the characters &apos; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> .
The most obvious use of pop music &quot; <unk> and gives context to &quot; Lester &apos; s attempts to <unk> his youth ; <unk> of how the <unk> of the 1960s &lt; unk &gt; American repression through music and <unk> , Lester begins to <unk> <unk> and <unk> to rock music .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; song choices &quot; progress through the history of American popular music &quot; .
Miller argues that although some may be over familiar , there is a &lt; unk &gt; element at work , &quot; making good on &#91; the film &apos; s &#93; <unk> that viewers look closer &quot; .
<unk> the end of the film , Thomas Newman &apos; s score features more <unk> , creating &quot; a <unk> <unk> &quot; that matches the tension of the <unk> .
The exception is &quot; Don &apos; t Let It &lt; unk &gt; You Down &quot; , which plays during Angela &apos; s <unk> of Lester .
At first appropriate , its tone clashes as the <unk> stops .
The lyrics , which speak of &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , can be seen as a <unk> for Lester &apos; s view of Angela — &quot; the &lt; unk &gt; , fantasy @ - @ driven <unk> of the &apos; American Beauty &apos; &quot; — as it <unk> away to reveal &quot; the <unk> , small @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; girl who , like his wife , has &lt; unk &gt; developed a false public self &quot; .
= = Production = = = = = Development = = = In 1997 , <unk> Ball <unk> to move into the film industry after several <unk> years writing for the television <unk> <unk> Under Fire and &lt; unk &gt; .
He joined the United <unk> Agency , where his representative , Andrew &lt; unk &gt; , suggested he write a &lt; unk &gt; script to &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &#91; himself &#93; to the town as a <unk> &quot; .
Ball pitched three ideas to &lt; unk &gt; : two conventional romantic <unk> and American Beauty , which he had originally <unk> as a play in the early 1990s .
Despite the story &apos; s lack of an easily &lt; unk &gt; concept , &lt; unk &gt; selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most <unk> .
While developing the script , Ball created another television <unk> , <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
He <unk> his anger and <unk> at having to &lt; unk &gt; to network demands on that show — and during his &lt; unk &gt; on <unk> Under Fire and &lt; unk &gt; — into writing American Beauty .
Ball did not expect to <unk> the script , believing it would act as more of a calling <unk> , but American Beauty drew interest from several production bodies .
&lt; unk &gt; passed the script to several producers , including Dan &lt; unk &gt; and Bruce Cohen , who took it to DreamWorks .
With the help of <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and Bob Cooper , and <unk> Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner , Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks ; he received &lt; unk &gt; from the studio — known at the time for its more conventional <unk> — that it would not &quot; iron the &#91; <unk> &#93; out &quot; .
In an unusual move , DreamWorks decided not to option the script ; instead , in April 1998 , the studio bought it <unk> for $ 250 @ , @ 000 , &lt; unk &gt; Fox &lt; unk &gt; Pictures , October <unk> , Metro @ - @ <unk> @ - @ <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; Entertainment .
DreamWorks planned to make the film for $ 6 – 8 million .
&lt; unk &gt; and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film &apos; s development , including <unk> and director selection .
The producers met with about 20 interested directors , several of whom were considered &quot; A @ - @ list &quot; at the time .
Ball was not keen on the more well @ - @ known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become &quot; <unk> about the content &quot; .
Nevertheless , the studio offered the film to <unk> <unk> and Robert &lt; unk &gt; ; neither accepted .
In the same year , &lt; unk &gt; ( then a theater director ) <unk> the musical &lt; unk &gt; in New York with fellow director Rob <unk> .
Beth &lt; unk &gt; of the <unk> <unk> Agency arranged meetings for &lt; unk &gt; with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility .
&lt; unk &gt; came across American Beauty in a <unk> of eight <unk> at &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s house , and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make ; early in his career , he had been inspired by how the film Paris , Texas ( 1984 ) presented contemporary America as a <unk> landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty , as well as <unk> with his own <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; later met with Spielberg ; impressed by &lt; unk &gt; &apos; productions of <unk> !
and &lt; unk &gt; , Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty .
&lt; unk &gt; found that he still had to convince DreamWorks &apos; production <unk> to let him direct .
He had already discussed the film with &lt; unk &gt; and Cohen , and felt they supported him .
Ball was also keen ; having seen &lt; unk &gt; , he was impressed with &lt; unk &gt; &apos; &quot; keen visual sense &quot; and thought he did not make obvious choices .
Ball felt that &lt; unk &gt; liked to look under the story &apos; s surface , a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of American Beauty .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; background also &lt; unk &gt; him , because of the prominent role the <unk> usually has in a theater production .
Over two meetings — the first with Cooper , Walter &lt; unk &gt; , and Laurie <unk> , the second with Cooper alone — &lt; unk &gt; pitched himself to the studio .
The studio soon approached &lt; unk &gt; with a deal to direct for the minimum <unk> allowed under <unk> Guild of America rules — $ 150 @ , @ 000 .
&lt; unk &gt; accepted , and later recalled that after <unk> and his agent &apos; s commission , he only earned $ 38 @ , @ 000 .
In June 1998 , DreamWorks confirmed that it had <unk> &lt; unk &gt; to direct the film .
= = = Writing = = = Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s .
In about 1991 – 92 , Ball saw a plastic bag <unk> in the wind outside the World <unk> Center .
He watched the bag for 10 minutes , saying later that it <unk> an &quot; <unk> emotional response &quot; .
In 1992 , Ball became <unk> with the media <unk> around the Amy <unk> trial .
&lt; unk &gt; a <unk> book telling of the <unk> , he was struck by how quickly it had become &lt; unk &gt; .
He said he &quot; felt like there was a real story <unk> &#91; that was &#93; more <unk> and way more <unk> &quot; than the story presented to the public , and attempted to turn the idea into a play .
Ball produced around 40 <unk> , but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film .
He felt that because of the visual themes , and because each character &apos; s story was <unk> &quot; <unk> personal &quot; , it could not be done on a stage .
All the main characters appeared in this version , but Carolyn did not feature strongly ; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles .
Ball based Lester &apos; s story on aspects of his own life .
Lester &apos; s re @ - @ <unk> of his life <unk> feelings Ball had in his mid @ - @ <unk> ; like Lester , Ball put aside his &lt; unk &gt; to work in <unk> he <unk> for people he did not <unk> .
<unk> in Ricky &apos; s household reflect Ball &apos; s own <unk> <unk> .
Ball <unk> his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col. &lt; unk &gt; , a man who &quot; gave up his chance to be himself &quot; .
Ball said the script &apos; s mix of comedy and <unk> was not <unk> , but that it came &lt; unk &gt; from his own <unk> on life .
He said the <unk> produced a &lt; unk &gt; contrast , giving each <unk> more impact than if they appeared alone .
In the script that was sent to <unk> actors and directors , Lester and Angela had sex ; by the time of shooting , Ball had <unk> the scene to the final version .
Ball initially <unk> <unk> from others that he change the script , feeling they were being &lt; unk &gt; ; the final &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> the scene came from DreamWorks &apos; then @ - @ president Walter &lt; unk &gt; .
He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek <unk> , the hero &quot; has a moment of &lt; unk &gt; before &#91; ... &#93; <unk> occurs &quot; .
Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had <unk> him to the idea that Lester needed to <unk> sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption .
&lt; unk &gt; and Cohen asked Ball not to <unk> the scene right away , as they felt it would be <unk> to make changes to the script before a director had been hired .
Early <unk> also included a <unk> to Col. &lt; unk &gt; &apos; service in the Marines , a sequence that <unk> established his homosexual &lt; unk &gt; .
In love with another Marine , Col. &lt; unk &gt; sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being <unk> for the &quot; <unk> &quot; of being gay .
Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film — Col. &lt; unk &gt; was the only character to have a <unk> — and because it removed the element of surprise from Col. &lt; unk &gt; &apos; later pass at Lester .
Ball said he had to write it for his own <unk> to know what happened to Col. &lt; unk &gt; , though all that remained in later <unk> was <unk> .
Ball remained involved throughout production ; he had signed a television show development deal , so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to American Beauty .
Ball was on @ - @ set for &lt; unk &gt; and to help <unk> his script for all but two days of filming .
His original &lt; unk &gt; scenes — in which Ricky and Jane are &lt; unk &gt; for Lester &apos; s murder after being <unk> by Col. &lt; unk &gt; — were &lt; unk &gt; in post @ - @ production ; the writer later felt the scenes were <unk> , saying they were a <unk> of his &quot; anger and <unk> &quot; at the time of writing ( see &quot; <unk> &quot; ) .
Ball and &lt; unk &gt; revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors , and twice more before the first read @ - @ through .
The shooting script features a scene in Angela &apos; s car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty ; the scene <unk> from earlier versions , which set it as a &quot; big scene on a <unk> &quot; in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body .
The change was a practical decision , as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs .
The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash , but only half a day was available .
Ball agreed , but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky &apos; s where he <unk> on having once seen a dead homeless woman : &quot; When you see something like that , it &apos; s like God is looking right at you , just for a second .
And if you &apos; re <unk> , you can look right back . &quot;
Jane asks : &quot; And what do you see ? &quot;
Ricky : &quot; Beauty . &quot;
Ball said , &quot; They wanted to cut that scene .
They said it &apos; s not important .
I said , &apos; You &apos; re out of your <unk> mind .
It &apos; s one of the most important scenes in the movie ! &apos;
&#91; ... &#93; If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie , that is the line . &quot;
Another scene was <unk> to <unk> the loss of the <unk> sequence ; set in a &lt; unk &gt; , it presents a &quot; turning point &quot; for Jane in that she <unk> to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela .
By the end of filming , the script had been through 10 <unk> .
= = = <unk> = = = &lt; unk &gt; had Spacey and &lt; unk &gt; in mind for the leads from the beginning , but DreamWorks <unk> were &lt; unk &gt; .
The studio suggested several &lt; unk &gt; , including Bruce <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , or John &lt; unk &gt; to play Lester , and <unk> Hunt or Holly <unk> to play Carolyn .
&lt; unk &gt; did not want a big star &quot; weighing the film down &quot; ; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> , and 1992 &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> .
Spacey was <unk> ; he said , &quot; I usually play characters who are very quick , very &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> .
&#91; ... &#93; I usually &lt; unk &gt; in dark , <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; waters .
This is a man living one step at a time , playing by his <unk> .
This is actually much closer to me , to what I <unk> , than those other parts . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; offered &lt; unk &gt; the role of Carolyn without the studio &apos; s <unk> ; although <unk> were upset at &lt; unk &gt; , by September 1998 , DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and &lt; unk &gt; .
Spacey <unk> based Lester &apos; s early &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; &lt; unk &gt; on Walter &lt; unk &gt; .
During the film , Lester &apos; s <unk> <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> ; Spacey worked out during filming to improve his body , but because &lt; unk &gt; shot the scenes out of <unk> order , Spacey <unk> &lt; unk &gt; to portray the stages .
Before filming , &lt; unk &gt; and Spacey <unk> Jack &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s performance in The &lt; unk &gt; ( 1960 ) , because &lt; unk &gt; wanted Spacey to <unk> &quot; the way &#91; &lt; unk &gt; &#93; moved , the way he looked , the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man &quot; .
Spacey &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; is a &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> Boulevard ( 1950 ) , which is also <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; by a dead character .
&lt; unk &gt; felt it evoked Lester &apos; s — and the film &apos; s — <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; recalled women from her youth to <unk> her performance : &quot; I used to &lt; unk &gt; constantly .
You &apos; d go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside , and then be inside their house and see the difference . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; and a hair <unk> <unk> to create a &quot; &lt; unk &gt; president &lt; unk &gt; &quot; <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; and production designer &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> @ - @ order &lt; unk &gt; to better establish Carolyn &apos; s environment of a &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; .
To help &lt; unk &gt; get into Carolyn &apos; s <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like .
He <unk> &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; version of the song &quot; Don &apos; t <unk> on My <unk> &quot; , which she enjoyed and <unk> the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn <unk> in her car .
For the roles of Jane , Ricky , and Angela , DreamWorks gave &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
By November 1998 , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , Wes Bentley , and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; had been cast in the parts — in <unk> &apos; s case , despite the fact she was &lt; unk &gt; for her <unk> scene .
As <unk> was 16 at the time she made the film , and thus classified as a minor in the United States , her parents had to <unk> her brief &lt; unk &gt; scene in the movie .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and they were on the set for the shooting of the scene .
Bentley &lt; unk &gt; competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast .
The 2009 <unk> My Big <unk> followed Bentley , and several other young actors , before and after he landed the part .
To prepare , &lt; unk &gt; provided Bentley with a video camera , telling the actor to film what Ricky would .
Peter <unk> and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; were cast ( as &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ) after filming began in December 1998 .
&lt; unk &gt; gave &lt; unk &gt; a book of paintings by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
He told her , &quot; <unk> character is in there <unk> . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; cut much of <unk> &apos; s <unk> , including <unk> between Colonel &lt; unk &gt; and her , as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was <unk> successfully through their shared moments of <unk> .
Chris Cooper plays Colonel &lt; unk &gt; , Scott <unk> plays Jim &lt; unk &gt; , and Sam &lt; unk &gt; plays Jim <unk> .
Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal , happy — and boring — couple in the film .
Ball &apos; s inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a &quot; <unk> , boring , <unk> couple &quot; who <unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; I can &apos; t <unk> for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring . &quot;
Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; insisted on two weeks of cast <unk> , although the <unk> were not as formal as he was used to in the theater , and the actors could not be present at every one .
Several &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> by the actors were incorporated into the script .
An early scene showing the &lt; unk &gt; leaving home for work was <unk> later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester &apos; s relationship had reached .
Spacey and &lt; unk &gt; worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another ; for example , the scene in which Lester almost &lt; unk &gt; Carolyn after the pair argues over Lester &apos; s <unk> a car was originally &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; .
= = = <unk> = = = Principal photography lasted about 50 days from December 14 , 1998 , to February 1999 .
American Beauty was filmed on <unk> at the Warner <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> , California , and at <unk> Park and &lt; unk &gt; in Los Angeles .
The aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in &lt; unk &gt; , California , and many of the school scenes were shot at South High School in &lt; unk &gt; , California ; several <unk> in the <unk> crowd were South High students .
The film is set in an upper middle @ - @ class neighborhood in an <unk> American town .
Production designer &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , but said , &quot; it &apos; s not about a place , it &apos; s about an &lt; unk &gt; .
&#91; ... &#93; The <unk> was <unk> much &lt; unk &gt; , USA — &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters , who are also &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; said , &quot; All of them are very <unk> , and their lives are &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
The &lt; unk &gt; &apos; household was designed as the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; — the former a <unk> <unk> , but &lt; unk &gt; and lacking in &quot; inner balance &quot; , leading to Carolyn &apos; s desire to at least give it the appearance of a &quot; perfect all @ - @ American household &quot; ; the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; home is depicted in &quot; <unk> darkness &#91; and &#93; <unk> &quot; .
The production selected two <unk> properties on the Warner &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &quot; &lt; unk &gt; Street &quot; for the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &apos; homes .
The crew rebuilt the houses to <unk> false rooms that established lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane &apos; s bedroom windows , and between Ricky &apos; s bedroom and Lester &apos; s <unk> .
The <unk> windows were designed specifically to obtain the <unk> shot toward the end of the film in which Col. &lt; unk &gt; — watching from Ricky &apos; s bedroom — <unk> <unk> that Lester is paying Ricky for sex .
&lt; unk &gt; made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of <unk> with the shot .
The house <unk> were filmed on the &lt; unk &gt; , on location , and on <unk> when overhead shots were needed .
The inside of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; home was shot at a house close to <unk> <unk> and <unk> Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; home was shot in the city &apos; s <unk> Park neighborhood .
Ricky &apos; s bedroom was designed to be <unk> @ - @ like to suggest his &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; <unk> , while at the same time <unk> with the high @ - @ <unk> equipment to reflect his &lt; unk &gt; side .
The production deliberately &lt; unk &gt; the use of red , as it was an important <unk> signature elsewhere .
The &lt; unk &gt; &apos; home uses cool <unk> , while the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; is kept in a &quot; <unk> military <unk> &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; <unk> visual style was <unk> and composed , with a &lt; unk &gt; design that provided &quot; a <unk> , almost <unk> feeling — a <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , hard <unk> , near &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ like take on American &lt; unk &gt; &quot; ; &lt; unk &gt; constantly directed his set &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> the frame .
He made Lester &apos; s fantasy scenes &quot; more <unk> and <unk> &quot; , and &lt; unk &gt; made minimal use of &lt; unk &gt; , feeling that stable shots generated more tension .
For example , when &lt; unk &gt; used a slow push in to the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; <unk> table , he held the shot because his training as a theater director <unk> him the importance of putting distance between the characters .
He wanted to keep the tension in the scene , so he only cut away when Jane left the table .
&lt; unk &gt; did use a hand @ - @ held camera for the scene in which Col. &lt; unk &gt; beats Ricky .
&lt; unk &gt; said the camera provided the scene with a &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &#91; ... &#93; off @ - @ balance energy &quot; .
He also went hand @ - @ held for the &lt; unk &gt; of Ricky &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; footage .
&lt; unk &gt; took a long time to get the quality of Ricky &apos; s footage to the level he wanted .
For the plastic @ - @ bag footage , &lt; unk &gt; used wind <unk> to move the bag in the air .
The scene took four takes ; two by the second unit did not <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , so he shot the scene himself .
He felt his first take lacked <unk> , but for the last attempt , he changed the location to the front of a <unk> wall and added leaves on the ground .
&lt; unk &gt; was <unk> by the way the wall gave <unk> to the <unk> of the bag .
&lt; unk &gt; avoided using close @ - @ ups , as he believed the technique was &lt; unk &gt; ; he also cited Spielberg &apos; s advice that he should <unk> an audience &lt; unk &gt; at the bottom of the camera monitor , to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a 40 @ - @ foot ( 10 m ) screen .
Spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also <unk> &lt; unk &gt; not to <unk> about costs if he had a &quot; great idea &quot; toward the end of a long working day .
&lt; unk &gt; said , &quot; That happened three or four times , and they are all in the movie . &quot;
Despite Spielberg &apos; s support , DreamWorks and &lt; unk &gt; fought constantly over the schedule and budget , although the studio &lt; unk &gt; little with the film &apos; s content .
Spacey , &lt; unk &gt; and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual <unk> .
American Beauty cost DreamWorks $ 15 million to produce , slightly above their <unk> <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; was so <unk> with his first three days &apos; filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to &lt; unk &gt; the scenes .
He said , &quot; I started with a <unk> scene , actually , a comedy scene .
And the actors played it way too big : &#91; ... &#93; it was badly shot , my fault , badly composed , my fault , bad <unk> , my fault &#91; ... &#93; ; and <unk> was doing what I was <unk> .
It was all my fault . &quot;
<unk> that he was a <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; drew on the experience of Hall : &quot; I made a very <unk> decision early on , if I didn &apos; t understand something <unk> , to say , without <unk> , &apos; I don &apos; t understand what you &apos; re talking about , <unk> <unk> it . &apos;
&quot; &lt; unk &gt; encouraged some <unk> ; for example , when Lester &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> <unk> Carolyn , the director asked Spacey to <unk> several &lt; unk &gt; for the act in each take .
&lt; unk &gt; said , &quot; I wanted that not just because it was <unk> &#91; ... &#93; but because I didn &apos; t want it to seem &lt; unk &gt; .
I wanted it to seem like he was &lt; unk &gt; it out of his mouth without thinking .
&#91; Spacey &#93; is so in control — I wanted him to break through . &quot;
Spacey <unk> , eventually coming up with 35 <unk> , but &lt; unk &gt; could not always keep a straight face , which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times .
The production used small amounts of computer @ - @ generated imagery .
Most of the rose &lt; unk &gt; in Lester &apos; s <unk> were added in post @ - @ production , although some were real and had the <unk> holding them <unk> removed .
When Lester &lt; unk &gt; about Angela in a rose @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , the steam was real , save for in the overhead shot .
To position the camera , a <unk> had to be cut in the ceiling , through which the steam escaped ; it was instead added <unk> .
= = = <unk> = = = American Beauty was edited by Christopher &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ; &lt; unk &gt; began in the position , but had to leave <unk> through post @ - @ production because of a <unk> conflict with Me , <unk> and <unk> ( 2000 ) ( in which Chris Cooper also starred ) .
&lt; unk &gt; and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; realized during <unk> that the film was different from the one he had envisioned .
He believed he had been making a &quot; much more <unk> , &#91; ... &#93; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; film than what came together in the <unk> <unk> .
Instead , &lt; unk &gt; was drawn to the <unk> and darkness ; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to &lt; unk &gt; to craft the film along these lines .
In total , he cut about 30 minutes from his original <unk> .
The opening included a dream in which Lester <unk> himself flying above the town .
&lt; unk &gt; spent two days filming Spacey against &lt; unk &gt; , but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too <unk> — &quot; like a &lt; unk &gt; brothers movie &quot; — and therefore <unk> for the tone he was trying to set .
The opening in the final cut <unk> a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father .
This scene was to be the <unk> to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester &apos; s death , as the way it was scored and <unk> made it clear that Jane &apos; s request was not serious .
However , in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full scene plays out later — &lt; unk &gt; used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a <unk> ambiguity as to his <unk> .
The subsequent shot — an aerial view of the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot for the &lt; unk &gt; effects in the dream sequence .
&lt; unk &gt; spent more time &lt; unk &gt; the first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together .
He &lt; unk &gt; several versions of the opening ; the first <unk> included &lt; unk &gt; scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester &apos; s murder , but &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; these in the last week of <unk> because he felt they made the film <unk> its mystery , and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production .
&lt; unk &gt; believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film &quot; into an episode of &lt; unk &gt; Blue &quot; .
Instead , he wanted the ending to be &quot; a poetic mixture of dream and memory and <unk> resolution &quot; .
When Ball first saw a completed <unk> , it was a version with <unk> versions of these scenes .
He felt that they were so short that they &quot; didn &apos; t really <unk> &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; and he <unk> , but Ball was more <unk> after &lt; unk &gt; cut the sequences completely ; Ball felt that without the scenes , the film was more <unk> and had evolved into something that &quot; for all its darkness had a really romantic heart &quot; .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; = = = <unk> Hall was not the first choice for director of photography ; &lt; unk &gt; believed he was &quot; too old and too experienced &quot; to want the job , and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with .
Instead , &lt; unk &gt; asked <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , who turned the job down because he did not like the script .
Hall was recommended to &lt; unk &gt; by <unk> <unk> , because of Hall &apos; s work on <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ( 1998 ) , which <unk> had executive produced .
&lt; unk &gt; was <unk> <unk> &apos; s then @ - @ wife <unk> <unk> in the play The Blue <unk> during &lt; unk &gt; on American Beauty , and had already &lt; unk &gt; the whole film .
Hall was involved for one month during &lt; unk &gt; ; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first <unk> of the script , and further passes allowed him to <unk> his approach before meeting &lt; unk &gt; .
Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters ; he only felt able to <unk> with them during cast <unk> , which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the <unk> .
Hall &apos; s approach was to create peaceful <unk> that evoked &lt; unk &gt; , to contrast with the <unk> on @ - @ screen events and allow audiences to take in the action .
Hall and &lt; unk &gt; first discussed the intended mood of a scene , but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary .
In most cases , Hall first <unk> the scene &apos; s subject by &quot; painting in &quot; the <unk> and <unk> , before adding fill light , which he <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; or white <unk> on the ceiling .
This approach gave Hall more control over the <unk> while keeping the fill light &lt; unk &gt; and the dark areas free of <unk> .
Hall shot American Beauty in a 2 @ .
@ 39 : 1 aspect <unk> in the Super 35 <unk> , using &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; 35 mm film <unk> .
He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ filled pool in its overhead shot , creating a frame around Angela within .
He shot the whole film at the same T @ - @ stop ( &lt; unk &gt; ) ; given his <unk> for shooting that wide , Hall favored high @ - @ speed <unk> to allow for more subtle lighting effects .
He used &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> with the company &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; series of prime and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Hall employed &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> for scenes with daylight effects .
He had difficulty <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s newly introduced <unk> release <unk> <unk> , which , combined with his contrast @ - @ heavy lighting style , created a look with too much contrast .
Hall <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , who sent him a <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; that was 5 % lower in contrast .
Hall used a 1 / 8 inch &lt; unk &gt; Black &lt; unk &gt; filter for almost every scene , which he said in &lt; unk &gt; may not have been the best choice , as the <unk> steps required to blow Super 35 up for its &lt; unk &gt; release <unk> led to a slight amount of <unk> ; therefore , the &lt; unk &gt; from the filter was not required .
When he saw the film in a theater , Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter , the &lt; unk &gt; from the Super 35 – &lt; unk &gt; conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended .
A shot where Lester and Ricky share a <unk> joint behind a building came from a <unk> between Hall and &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence ; Hall assumed the characters would look for <unk> , so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building , <unk> to light from the top of the truck .
When &lt; unk &gt; returned , he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen .
He removed the truck and Hall had to <unk> the lighting ; he <unk> it from the left , with a large light crossing the actors , and with a <unk> light behind the camera .
Hall felt the <unk> wide shot &quot; worked <unk> for the tone of the scene &quot; .
Hall made sure to keep rain , or the <unk> of it , in every shot near the end of the film .
In one shot during Lester &apos; s encounter with Angela at the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; home , Hall created rain effects on the <unk> cross <unk> ; in another , he partly <unk> the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run <unk> , <unk> the light ( although the strength of the outside light was <unk> for a night scene , Hall felt it <unk> because of the strong <unk> it produced ) .
For the close @ - @ ups when Lester and Angela move to the &lt; unk &gt; , Hall tried to keep rain in the frame , lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester .
He also used rain <unk> to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room .
= = = Music = = = Thomas Newman &apos; s score was recorded in Santa <unk> , California .
He mainly used <unk> instruments to create the mood and rhythm , the inspiration for which was provided by &lt; unk &gt; .
Newman &quot; favored <unk> , rhythm , and <unk> over melody &quot; , making for a more &lt; unk &gt; score than he had previously created .
He built each <unk> around &quot; small , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> &quot; — often , the only variety through a &quot; <unk> of the <unk> for eight <unk> &quot; .
The <unk> instruments included &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; ; also featured were <unk> , <unk> , and world music instruments .
Newman also used electronic music and on &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; tracks employed more <unk> <unk> , such as <unk> metal <unk> <unk> with a <unk> and using a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Newman believed the score helped move the film along without <unk> the &quot; moral ambiguity &quot; of the script : &quot; It was a real <unk> <unk> act in terms of what music worked to preserve &#91; that &#93; . &quot;
The soundtrack features songs by Newman , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , The Who , Free , &lt; unk &gt; , The &lt; unk &gt; Who , Bill &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Lee , The <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , and Bob <unk> , as well as two cover versions — The <unk> &apos; &quot; Because &quot; performed by <unk> Smith , and <unk> Young &apos; s &quot; Don &apos; t Let It &lt; unk &gt; You Down &quot; performed by <unk> <unk> .

An album featuring 19 tracks from Newman &apos; s score was released on January 11 , 2000 , and won the Grammy Award for Best <unk> <unk> Album .
&lt; unk &gt; considered the score to be one of Newman &apos; s best , saying it &quot; &#91; enabled &#93; the film &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; .
In 2006 , the magazine chose the score as one of 20 essential <unk> it believed <unk> to the &quot; complex and <unk> <unk> between music and screen <unk> &quot; .

DreamWorks did not want to <unk> screen the film ; according to &lt; unk &gt; , the studio was pleased with it , but he insisted on one where he could question the audience <unk> .

Although &lt; unk &gt; was well received by the British establishment , the work suffered from what &lt; unk &gt; called a &quot; &lt; unk &gt; of process &quot; , and he considered requesting a transfer in <unk> .
In 1800 it ground to a <unk> because another board established by the <unk> to <unk> outstanding Revolutionary War claims against the United States had not yet met , and the British stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; used this break to briefly return to America and <unk> the condition of his &lt; unk &gt; estate , where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in &lt; unk &gt; .

However , many of the plans were <unk> altered after the <unk> of Manila during World War II and by subsequent <unk> .
The city , as the capital , still hosts the Office of the President , as well as the president &apos; s official residence .

Development of the <unk> system began in the 1970s under the Marcos administration , making it the first light rail transport in Southeast Asia .
These systems are currently undergoing a <unk> @ - @ <unk> expansion .
&lt; unk &gt; Line 1 runs along the length of Taft Avenue ( R @ - @ 2 ) and &lt; unk &gt; Avenue ( R @ - @ 9 ) , and the &lt; unk &gt; Line 2 runs along &lt; unk &gt; M. &lt; unk &gt; Avenue ( C @ - @ 1 ) and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; Boulevard ( R @ - @ 6 ) from Santa Cruz , through &lt; unk &gt; City , up to &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; .

One <unk> <unk> within Metro Manila is in operation .
The line runs in a general north @ - @ south direction from &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) toward &lt; unk &gt; .
The Port of Manila , located in the vicinity of Manila Bay is the chief <unk> of the Philippines .
The &lt; unk &gt; River <unk> Service which runs on the &lt; unk &gt; River is another form of transportation .
The city is also served by the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; International <unk> and <unk> International <unk> .
In 2006 , <unk> magazine ranked Manila &quot; the world &apos; s most &lt; unk &gt; city &quot; .
Manila has become <unk> for its frequent traffic <unk> and high <unk> .
The government has undertaken several projects to <unk> the traffic in the city .
Some of the projects include : the construction of a new <unk> at &lt; unk &gt; , the construction of the Metro Manila &lt; unk &gt; <unk> 3 , the proposed &lt; unk &gt; Line 2 ( west ) extension from &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; or the Port Area , and the expansion of several national and local roads .
However , such projects have yet to make any <unk> impact , and the traffic <unk> and <unk> continue <unk> .
The urban planning of the Manila and the whole <unk> was based on the Metro Manila <unk> <unk> , which seeks to <unk> the problems of Metro Manila &apos; s urban planning and transportation .
It consists of a list of short term <unk> projects and medium to long term infrastructure projects that will last up to &lt; unk &gt; .

The national government controls the University of the Philippines Manila , the oldest of the University of the Philippines <unk> universities and the center of health <unk> education in the country .
The city is also the site of the <unk> University of the Philippines , the largest university in the country in terms of student population .
The University <unk> refers to the area where there is a high <unk> or a cluster of colleges and universities in the city and it is commonly <unk> as the one where the San Miguel , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; districts meet .

Each of the colleges and universities found here are at a short walking distance of each other .
Another cluster of colleges lies along the southern bank of the &lt; unk &gt; River , mostly at the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; districts , and still a smaller cluster is found at the <unk> part of &lt; unk &gt; near the border with &lt; unk &gt; such as the private co @ - @ educational <unk> of De La <unk> University , the largest of all De La <unk> University System of schools .
The Division of the City <unk> of Manila , a branch of the Department of Education , refers to the city &apos; s three @ - @ <unk> public education system .

This &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , non @ - @ <unk> genus includes both small &lt; unk &gt; lacking an &lt; unk &gt; stem and large trees .
The genus has a complicated <unk> history , and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers .
Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers , the existence of intermediate <unk> types and the existence of <unk> between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus .
This has been supported by a recent <unk> phylogeny .
<unk> between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus , with estimates of as many as 100 .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species , or groups of similar species .
&lt; unk &gt; species have a long history of human use , and include <unk> important sources of palm oil and <unk> .
Many species are fire <unk> and <unk> in disturbed <unk> .
Their seeds are animal dispersed , including some which are thought to have been adapted for <unk> by now @ - @ <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
= = <unk> = = The genus &lt; unk &gt; has &lt; unk &gt; compound leaves — rows of <unk> emerge on either side of the <unk> of the <unk> in a <unk> @ - @ like or &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ like pattern .
<unk> are also non @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and includes both large trees with <unk> <unk> up to 30 metres ( 98 ft ) tall and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( one which lack an &lt; unk &gt; stem ) .
The number of leaves per individual <unk> from about three to thirty @ - @ five ; larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves .
&lt; unk &gt; are large , <unk> and <unk> among the leaves .
The &lt; unk &gt; consists of a main <unk> — the &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; — and a series of smaller <unk> , the &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; , which <unk> the flowers , emerge from the &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; is the main <unk> , connecting the &lt; unk &gt; with the stem .
&lt; unk &gt; either <unk> entirely of male flowers , or are predominantly female with a few male flowers .
<unk> usually have two or three seeds , although fewer or more are present in some species , and are usually <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @ - @ <unk> or <unk> when mature .
Four different types of male flowers exist .
On the basis of these <unk> types , the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
The species sometimes referred to &lt; unk &gt; have <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , while the other groups have straight ones .
The &lt; unk &gt; of those placed in &lt; unk &gt; are much <unk> than the &lt; unk &gt; , while those placed in &lt; unk &gt; and a more narrowly defined &lt; unk &gt; have &lt; unk &gt; that are longer than the &lt; unk &gt; .
Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups ; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus .
= = <unk> = = &lt; unk &gt; has been placed in the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , together with the genera &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
Within this &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; has been found to be a <unk> group , and sister to the clade containing &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> as to whether &lt; unk &gt; should be considered a single genus , or a group of related genera .
In their 1996 Field <unk> to the &lt; unk &gt; of the Americas , Andrew Henderson , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; combined all the species in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( as it was then defined ) into a single genus , &lt; unk &gt; .
In his 1999 &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of Palm &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , American <unk> <unk> F. &lt; unk &gt; divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and John &lt; unk &gt; recognised a single genus in their 2005 World &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; , and Jean @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; continued this <unk> in his 2008 review of the genus .
The <unk> @ - @ genus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers ; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another .
Four of the genera — &lt; unk &gt; ( in a narrow sense ) , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; — <unk> to four different types of male flowers found within the genus .
However , a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types , including A.
&lt; unk &gt; ( which &lt; unk &gt; placed in its own genus , &lt; unk &gt; ) and this has been used as an argument for the single @ - @ genus approach .
In addition , there are several <unk> between species that would be considered different genera under &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s five @ - @ genus system , which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus .
In 2009 <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> published a <unk> phylogeny of the &lt; unk &gt; which found that some species placed in &lt; unk &gt; were actually more closely related to species placed in &lt; unk &gt; than they were to other members of that genus ( if the five @ - @ genus approach was used ) , while A.
&lt; unk &gt; , placed in &lt; unk &gt; by &lt; unk &gt; , was actually a sister to both &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
= = = History = = = The genus &lt; unk &gt; was first described Carl &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> based on specimens collected by Alexander von <unk> and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , although older , pre @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> exist , including Charles &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> description of A.
&lt; unk &gt; .
The genus was named for &lt; unk &gt; III &lt; unk &gt; , king of &lt; unk &gt; , known for his interest in &lt; unk &gt; plants .
The type species is A.
&lt; unk &gt; , a <unk> <unk> .
The genera &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; were described by Carl Friedrich <unk> von &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> and <unk> respectively .
&lt; unk &gt; was described by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; by &lt; unk &gt; F. <unk> in 1942 .
= = = <unk> = = = <unk> <unk> about the number of species in the genus &lt; unk &gt; ( broadly defined ) .
In 1965 , Dutch &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; <unk> estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus .
In their 1996 Field <unk> to the &lt; unk &gt; of the Americas Andrew Henderson and &lt; unk &gt; recognised 29 species in the genus , while <unk> &lt; unk &gt; recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group .
<unk> following &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s lead , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and John &lt; unk &gt; recognised 67 species in their 2005 World &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; .
An important element of this <unk> is the decision by &lt; unk &gt; to define species more narrowly than Henderson .
As a result , what Henderson interpreted as variation within species , &lt; unk &gt; took as differences between &lt; unk &gt; similar species .
This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in &lt; unk &gt; collections .
The large size of the leaves , <unk> and fruit of many &lt; unk &gt; species makes them difficult to collect .
In addition , many important collections , including type <unk> , have been lost or destroyed .
&lt; unk &gt; or incomplete collections make it difficult to <unk> variation within a single species from variation between different species .
The three recent <unk> ( Henderson and &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ) recognised a total of <unk> species , but only 20 species are accepted by all of them .
The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40 .
For example , what Andrew Henderson considered a single species , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , other <unk> have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> the <unk> of A.
&lt; unk &gt; as a species , and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A.
&lt; unk &gt; — A.
&lt; unk &gt; , A.
&lt; unk &gt; , A.
&lt; unk &gt; and A.
&lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; accepted both &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s four species and A.
&lt; unk &gt; .
However , Jean @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; was of the <unk> that A.
&lt; unk &gt; , A.
&lt; unk &gt; and A.
&lt; unk &gt; were all very similar , and thought it likely that they all represented the same species .
Another species complex in &lt; unk &gt; includes A.
&lt; unk &gt; and related species .
Henderson ( 1995 ) recognised A.
&lt; unk &gt; and A.
&lt; unk &gt; , considering the latter to either be an &lt; unk &gt; form of A.
&lt; unk &gt; or a <unk> between it and A.
&lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; accepted A.
&lt; unk &gt; , but &lt; unk &gt; considered it a <unk> <unk> .

= Free Derry = Free Derry ( Irish : &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) was a self @ - @ declared <unk> nationalist area of Derry , Northern Ireland , that existed between 1969 and 1972 .
Its name was taken from a sign painted on a <unk> wall in the &lt; unk &gt; in January 1969 which read , &quot; You are now entering Free Derry &quot; .
The area , which included the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , was secured by community <unk> for the first time on 5 January 1969 following an <unk> into the &lt; unk &gt; by members of the Royal Ulster <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
<unk> built barricades and carried <unk> and similar arms to prevent the &lt; unk &gt; from entering .
After six days the residents took down the barricades and &lt; unk &gt; patrols resumed , but tensions remained high over the following months .
<unk> reached a peak on 12 August 1969 , <unk> in the Battle of the &lt; unk &gt; — a three @ - @ day pitched battle between residents and the &lt; unk &gt; .
On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed at the edge of the &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; were withdrawn .
The Derry <unk> Defence Association ( &lt; unk &gt; ) declared their intention to hold the area against both the &lt; unk &gt; and the British Army until their demands were met .
The British Army made no attempt to enter the area .
The situation continued until October 1969 when , following publication of the Hunt <unk> , military police were allowed in .
The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) began to re @ - @ arm and <unk> after August 1969 .
In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA .
Both were supported by the people of the Free Derry area .
Meanwhile , relations between the British Army and the nationalist community , which were initially good , <unk> .
In July 1971 there was a <unk> of <unk> into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops .
The government introduced &lt; unk &gt; on 9 August 1971 , and in response , barricades went up once more in the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
This time , Free Derry was a no @ - @ go area , defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA .
From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army , and the &lt; unk &gt; began a bombing campaign in the city centre .
As before , unarmed &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; <unk> the barricades , and crime was <unk> with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police .
Support for the IRA increased further after Bloody Sunday in January 1972 , when thirteen unarmed men and <unk> were shot dead by the British Army &apos; s Parachute Regiment at a march in the &lt; unk &gt; ( a <unk> man was wounded and died 4 <unk> months later ) .
The support began to &lt; unk &gt; after the killing by the Official IRA of a local youth who was home on leave from the British Army .
After a Provisional IRA ceasefire , during which it entered talks with the British government , broke down , the British took the decision to move against the &quot; no @ - @ go &quot; areas .
Free Derry came to an end on 31 July 1972 , when thousands of British troops moved in with armoured cars and &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> the area .
= = Background = = Derry City lies near the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland .
It has a majority nationalist population , and nationalists won a majority of <unk> in the 1920 local elections .
Despite this , the Ulster <unk> Party controlled the local council , &lt; unk &gt; Corporation , from 1923 onwards .
The &lt; unk &gt; maintained their majority , <unk> , by <unk> the <unk> <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) so that the South Ward , with a nationalist majority , returned eight <unk> while the much smaller North Ward and &lt; unk &gt; Ward , with <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , returned twelve <unk> between them ; &lt; unk &gt; , by allowing only &lt; unk &gt; to vote in local elections , rather than one man , one vote , so that a higher number of nationalists , who did not own homes , were <unk> ; and &lt; unk &gt; , by <unk> houses to nationalists outside the South Ward <unk> .
The result was that there were about 2 @ , @ 000 nationalist families , and <unk> no <unk> , on the housing <unk> list , and that housing in the nationalist area was <unk> and of a very poor condition .
The South Ward <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , Bishop Street and <unk> Road , and it was this area that would become Free Derry .
The Derry <unk> Action Committee ( &lt; unk &gt; ) was formed in March 1968 by members of the Derry Branch of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the James &lt; unk &gt; Republican Club , including &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
It <unk> a meeting of &lt; unk &gt; Corporation in March 1968 and in May blocked traffic by placing a <unk> that was home to a family of four in the middle of the &lt; unk &gt; Road in the &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> a sit @ - @ down protest at the opening of the second deck of the &lt; unk &gt; Bridge .
After the meeting of &lt; unk &gt; Corporation was again <unk> in August , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> the Northern Ireland Civil <unk> Association ( &lt; unk &gt; ) and invited them to hold a march in Derry .
The date chosen was 5 October 1968 , an &lt; unk &gt; committee was formed ( although in reality most of the <unk> was done by &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ) and the route was to take the &lt; unk &gt; inside the city walls , where nationalists were traditionally not <unk> to march .
The Minister of Home Affairs , William Craig , made an order on 3 October <unk> the march on the grounds that the &lt; unk &gt; Boys of Derry were <unk> to hold a march on the same day .
In the words of Martin &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; &quot; this particular <unk> ... provided the <unk> needed to <unk> the march . &quot;
When the &lt; unk &gt; attempted to <unk> the <unk> on 5 October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) <unk> .
The police drew their &lt; unk &gt; and struck &lt; unk &gt; , including &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Eddie &lt; unk &gt; and Westminster <unk> Gerry &lt; unk &gt; .
Subsequently the police &quot; broke <unk> and used their &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; on people in Duke Street &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; trying to escape met another party of police and &quot; these police also used their &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
Water <unk> were also used .
The police action caused <unk> in the nationalist area of Derry , and at a meeting four days later the Derry <unk> &apos; Action Committee ( &lt; unk &gt; ) was formed , with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vice @ - @ chairman .

They organised a march from Belfast to Derry in support of civil rights , starting out with about <unk> young people on 1 January 1969 .
The march met with violent opposition from <unk> counter @ - @ <unk> at several points along the route .
Finally , at &lt; unk &gt; Bridge , five miles outside Derry , they were attacked by a <unk> of about two hundred <unk> <unk> — some of them <unk> with <unk> — and <unk> .

The remainder continued on to Derry where they were attacked once more on their way to &lt; unk &gt; Bridge before they finally reached <unk> Square , where they held a <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; broke out after the <unk> .
Police drove &lt; unk &gt; into the &lt; unk &gt; , but did not come after them .
In the early hours of the following morning , 5 January , members of the &lt; unk &gt; charged into St. &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; Road in the &lt; unk &gt; , breaking windows and beating residents .

That <unk> , which was a popular <unk> for meetings , later became known as &quot; Free Derry <unk> &quot; .
On 7 January , the &lt; unk &gt; area was extended to include the &lt; unk &gt; , another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the &lt; unk &gt; .
A <unk> radio station calling itself &quot; Radio Free Derry &quot; began <unk> to residents , playing rebel songs and <unk> resistance .
On a small number of occasions law @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; attempted <unk> , but were <unk> with by the patrols .
Despite all this , the Irish Times reported that &quot; the infrastructure of <unk> control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols . &quot;
Following some <unk> of destruction and of violence late in the week , members of the &lt; unk &gt; including Ivan Cooper addressed residents on Friday , 10 January and called on them to &lt; unk &gt; the barricades .

With fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining , the police marched out through the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Gate , even as the residents were entering from the far side .
The barricades were not maintained on this <unk> , and <unk> patrols were not prevented .

= = IRA <unk> = = The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) had been <unk> <unk> since the end of the <unk> Campaign in 1962 .
It was low in both personnel and equipment — Chief of Staff &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; told &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> <unk> in August 1969 that he &quot; <unk> &apos; t defend the &lt; unk &gt; .
I <unk> &apos; t the men nor the guns to do it . &quot;
During the 1960s the leadership of the <unk> movement had moved to the left .
Its focus was on class <unk> and its <unk> was to <unk> the Irish nationalist and <unk> working <unk> in order to <unk> <unk> , both British and Irish .
Republican &lt; unk &gt; were formed in Northern Ireland , where &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> .
These <unk> were involved in the formation of &lt; unk &gt; in 1967 .
In Derry , the James &lt; unk &gt; Republican Club worked closely with Labour Party radicals , with whom they set up the Derry <unk> Action Committee and Derry &lt; unk &gt; Action Committee .
The Derry <unk> &apos; Defence Association was formed initially by &lt; unk &gt; , who then invited other nationalists to join .
Although there were tensions between the younger <unk> like &lt; unk &gt; White and the older , traditional &lt; unk &gt; such as &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , both sides saw the unrest of 1968 @ - @ 69 as a chance to advance <unk> <unk> , and the two shared the platform at the <unk> <unk> commemoration in April 1969 .
The events of August 1969 in Derry , and more particularly in Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes , brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the &lt; unk &gt; , and led to a split in December 1969 into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA .
Initially , both armies organised for defensive purposes only , although the &lt; unk &gt; were planning towards an offensive campaign .
In Derry there was far less <unk> between the two <unk> than elsewhere and &lt; unk &gt; commonly paid <unk> to both .
When &lt; unk &gt; were arrested after the Official &apos; s <unk> parade in March 1970 , <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; their trial together .
At the start the <unk> attracted most of the younger members .
Martin <unk> , who in August 1969 had helped defend the barricades , initially joined the <unk> , but a few months later left to join the &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> between the British Army and the residents had steadily <unk> since the first appearance of troops in August 1969 .
In September , after clashes between nationalist and <unk> <unk> that led to the death of a <unk> man , William King , the British Army erected a &apos; peace ring &apos; to &lt; unk &gt; the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled .
Roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets .
Although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary , there was anger among young people .
&lt; unk &gt; between <unk> and troops became more frequent .
The <unk> following the <unk> &apos; <unk> parade in March 1970 marked the first time that the army used &apos; &lt; unk &gt; squads &apos; , who <unk> into the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; to make <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; squads soon became a common feature of army <unk> operations .
There was also a belief that they were <unk> people at <unk> , sometimes days after the alleged <unk> , and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance .
The &lt; unk &gt; were <unk> as &lt; unk &gt; by &lt; unk &gt; , who saw the <unk> as <unk> attempts to <unk> the situation .
The Labour radicals and Official &lt; unk &gt; , still working together , tried to turn the youth away from <unk> and create <unk> organizations — one such organization was named the Young &lt; unk &gt; Association — but to no &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; , while &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> , viewed them as the <unk> <unk> of British occupation .
This philosophy was more attractive to &lt; unk &gt; , and some of them joined the Provisional IRA .
The deaths of two leading &lt; unk &gt; in a <unk> explosion in June 1970 resulted in young <unk> becoming more prominent in the organization .
Nevertheless , up to July 1971 the Provisional IRA remained <unk> small .
Two men , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> <unk> , were shot dead in separate <unk> in the early morning and afternoon of 8 July 1971 .
They were the first people to be killed by the British Army in Derry .
In both cases the British Army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs , while &lt; unk &gt; insisted that both were unarmed .
The Social <unk> and Labour Party ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , the newly formed party of which John Hume and Ivan Cooper were leading members , withdrew from &lt; unk &gt; in protest , but among residents there was a <unk> that moderate policies had failed .
The result was a <unk> of support for the IRA .
The &lt; unk &gt; held a meeting the following Sunday at which they called on people to &quot; join the IRA &quot; .
Following the meeting , people &lt; unk &gt; up to join , and there was large @ - @ scale <unk> .
The British Army post at &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> came under sustained attack , and troops there and around the city came under fire from the IRA .
= = &lt; unk &gt; and the third Free Derry = = The increasing violence in Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that &lt; unk &gt; without trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland , and on 9 August 1971 hundreds of &lt; unk &gt; and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids .
In Derry , residents came out onto the streets to <unk> the <unk> , and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere ; nevertheless leading figures including &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; White were interned .
In response , barricades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence .
Unlike its <unk> , this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence , both Official and Provisional .
It was defended by armed &lt; unk &gt; — a no @ - @ go area , one in which British security forces were unable to operate .
<unk> attacks on the British Army increased .
Six soldiers were wounded in the first day after &lt; unk &gt; , and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either IRA in Derry .
The army moved in in force on 18 August to &lt; unk &gt; the barricades .
A gun battle <unk> in which a young Provisional IRA officer , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , was killed .
A crowd <unk> a sit @ - @ down protest was &lt; unk &gt; down and the <unk> , including John Hume and Ivan Cooper , arrested .
With barricades re @ - @ appearing as quickly as they were removed , the army eventually abandoned their attempt .
The Derry &lt; unk &gt; had little contact with the IRA elsewhere .
They had few weapons ( about twenty ) which they used mainly for <unk> .
At the same time , they launched their bombing campaign in Derry .
Unlike in Belfast , they were <unk> to avoid killing or <unk> <unk> people .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; wrote that &quot; the Derry &lt; unk &gt; , under Martin <unk> , had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties . &quot;
Although both &lt; unk &gt; operated openly , neither was in control of Free Derry .
The barricades were <unk> by unarmed &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; .
<unk> was <unk> with by a volunteer force called the Free Derry Police , which was headed by <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , a Derry <unk> and Northern Ireland International .
= = Bloody Sunday = = An anti @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; protest organised by the Northern Ireland Civil <unk> Association ( &lt; unk &gt; ) at &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in January 1972 was met with violence from the 1st Battalion , The Parachute Regiment ( 1 &lt; unk &gt; ) .
&lt; unk &gt; had organised a march from the &lt; unk &gt; to Derry city centre , in <unk> of a <unk> , on the following Sunday , 30 January 1972 .
Both &lt; unk &gt; were asked , and agreed , to <unk> operations on that day to ensure the march passed off <unk> .
The British Army erected barricades around the Free Derry area to prevent &lt; unk &gt; from reaching the city centre .
On the day , march <unk> turned the march away from the <unk> and up to Free Derry <unk> , but some <unk> proceeded to the barrier at William Street and &lt; unk &gt; soldiers .
<unk> from 1 &lt; unk &gt; then moved into Free Derry and opened fire , killing thirteen people , all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed .
A <unk> shooting <unk> died four months later in June 1972 .
Like the killing of &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> the previous year , Bloody Sunday had the effect of <unk> increasing <unk> to the IRA , even among people who previously would have been &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; .
= = February - July 1972 = = Both the Provisional and Official IRA <unk> up attacks after Bloody Sunday , with the <unk> support of the residents .
Local feelings changed , however , with the killing of <unk> William Best by the Official IRA .
Best was a 19 @ - @ year @ - @ old local man who was home on leave from the British Army at his parents &apos; house in the &lt; unk &gt; .
He was <unk> , <unk> and shot .
The following day 500 women marched to the Republican Club offices in protest .

The Provisional IRA initially stated that they would not follow suit , but after <unk> approaches to the British Government they announced a ceasefire from 26 June .
Martin <unk> was the Derry representative in a party of senior &lt; unk &gt; who travelled to London for talks with William &lt; unk &gt; , the <unk> of State for Northern Ireland .
The talks were not resumed after the ending of the <unk> following a violent <unk> in Belfast when troops prevented Catholic families from taking over houses in the &lt; unk &gt; estate .
Political pressure for the action against the &quot; no @ - @ go &quot; areas increased after the events of Bloody Friday in Belfast .
A British Army attack was considered <unk> , and the IRA took the decision not to <unk> it .
On 31 July 1972 , Operation &lt; unk &gt; was launched when thousands of British troops , equipped with armoured cars and armoured &lt; unk &gt; ( <unk> ) , <unk> the barricades and occupied the area .

Over the following years IRA violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe &apos; the war was over &apos; in the area , although there were still frequent street <unk> .
<unk> — even those who did not support the IRA — remained &lt; unk &gt; opposed to the army and to the state .
Many of the residents &apos; original <unk> were addressed with the passing of the Local Government ( Northern Ireland ) Act , 1972 , which &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> <unk> and introduced universal adult <unk> based on the single &lt; unk &gt; vote .

While the &lt; unk &gt; of NY 93 have remained the same to this day , several portions of the route have been realigned since that time .
When NY 93 was first assigned , it turned south at the hamlet of North Ridge and <unk> with NY 425 along &lt; unk &gt; – Wilson Road to Lower Mountain Road , then part of NY 3 .
NY 425 went west from this junction while NY 93 headed eastward , following NY 3 along Lower Mountain , <unk> Hill , Upper Mountain , and Saunders Settlement roads to the city of &lt; unk &gt; .
At &lt; unk &gt; Street , NY 93 left NY 3 and <unk> the city along &lt; unk &gt; , High , and &lt; unk &gt; streets and &lt; unk &gt; Road .
It met its current <unk> southeast of the city in &lt; unk &gt; .
NY 3 was realigned c .

The former routing of NY 3 along &lt; unk &gt; , Lower Mountain , <unk> Hill , and Upper Mountain roads was <unk> as NY &lt; unk &gt; even though all of NY 3 &apos; s former routing was already part of either NY 425 or NY 93 .
The NY &lt; unk &gt; designation was eliminated c .
<unk> when NY 3 was <unk> eastward to a new western <unk> in central New York .
In the early 1940s , NY 93 was altered to follow North Ridge Road , U.S. Route 104 ( now NY 104 ) , and Junction Road between North Ridge and Lower Mountain Road .
Around the same time that NY 93 was <unk> , NY 270 was also extended northward along Junction Road from NY 31 to US 104 .
As a result , NY 93 <unk> NY 270 between Lower Mountain Road and US 104 .
The <unk> with NY 270 remained in place until c .
1963 when NY 270 was <unk> southward to the intersection of Lower Mountain and Junction roads .
NY 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass Lower Mountain and <unk> Hill Roads on Junction and Upper Mountain roads , replacing NY 270 along Junction Road .

NY 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to Robinson Road , where it turned east and followed Robinson Road ( CR <unk> ) and &lt; unk &gt; Road ( CR 133 ) to &lt; unk &gt; Road in &lt; unk &gt; .
The portion of &lt; unk &gt; Road ( NY 93 &apos; s former routing ) east of the &lt; unk &gt; city limits became NY &lt; unk &gt; , an <unk> reference route .
&lt; unk &gt; and maintenance of Robinson Road from the bypass to NY 78 was transferred from Niagara County to the state of New York on September 1 , 1990 , as part of a highway maintenance <unk> between the two levels of government .
The portion of NY 93 between NY 78 and &lt; unk &gt; Road became state @ - @ maintained on October 1 , 1998 , as part of another <unk> that also transferred <unk> and maintenance of &lt; unk &gt; Road to Niagara County .
&lt; unk &gt; Road is now CR <unk> .
On November 1 , 2005 , the Niagara County <unk> voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation ( &lt; unk &gt; ) to <unk> the NY 93 designation from Upper Mountain Road , a county @ - @ maintained highway , and &lt; unk &gt; it to Junction Road ( NY 270 ) and Saunders Settlement Road ( NY 31 ) .

The Commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who died as a result of enemy action during World War II .
The Commission was founded by &lt; unk &gt; Ware and <unk> through Royal <unk> in 1917 named the Imperial War Graves Commission .
The change to the present name took place in 1960 .
The Commission , as part of its <unk> , is responsible for commemorating all Commonwealth war dead <unk> and equally .
To this end , the war dead are commemorated by name on a &lt; unk &gt; , at an identified site of a burial , or on a memorial .

= = History = = = = = World War I = = = On the <unk> of World War I in 1914 , &lt; unk &gt; Ware , a director of the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; Company , found that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army .
He used the influence of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; chairman , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , to become the commander of a <unk> unit of the British Red Cross .
He arrived in France in September 1914 and <unk> there was struck by the lack of any official <unk> for <unk> or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt <unk> to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose .
In March 1915 , with the support of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ General of the British <unk> Force , Ware &apos; s work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves &lt; unk &gt; Commission .
The new Graves &lt; unk &gt; Commission had over 31 @ , @ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @ , @ 000 registered by May 1916 .
When <unk> &lt; unk &gt; began to &lt; unk &gt; Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to <unk> land for further &lt; unk &gt; .
Ware began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French &lt; unk &gt; under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government .
Ware eventually concluded that it was not &lt; unk &gt; to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , <unk> it in &lt; unk &gt; , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British .
The French government agreed under the condition that &lt; unk &gt; respected certain <unk> , were <unk> by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or <unk> .
<unk> negotiations were started with the <unk> government .
As reports of the grave <unk> work became public , the Commission began to <unk> letters of <unk> and <unk> for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers .
By 1917 , 17 @ , @ 000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives .
In March 1915 , the Commission , with the support of the Red Cross , began to <unk> <unk> <unk> and cemetery location information in <unk> to the <unk> .
The Graves &lt; unk &gt; Commission became the <unk> of Graves &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to <unk> beyond simple grave <unk> and began to include <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; from relatives of those killed .
The &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other <unk> of war , with units deployed in Greece , Egypt and <unk> .
= = = <unk> establishment = = = As the war continued , Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post @ - @ war period .
Following a <unk> by the British Army , the National Committee for the <unk> of <unk> &apos; Graves was appointed by the British government in January 1916 , with Edward , Prince of Wales <unk> to serve as president .
The National Committee for the <unk> of <unk> &apos; Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the <unk> of Graves &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; after the war .
The government felt that it was more appropriate to &lt; unk &gt; the work to a <unk> appointed body rather than to any existing government department .
By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves .
With the help of Edward , Prince of Wales , Ware <unk> a <unk> to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be <unk> .
The <unk> was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal <unk> , with the Prince of Wales serving as president , <unk> of State for War Lord <unk> as chairman and Ware as vice @ - @ chairman .
The Commission &apos; s <unk> began in <unk> at the end of the First World War .
Once land for &lt; unk &gt; and memorials had been <unk> , the <unk> task of recording the details of the dead could begin .
By 1918 , some &lt; unk &gt; @ , @ 000 graves had been identified and a further &lt; unk &gt; @ , @ 000 casualties were registered as having no known grave .
The scale , and associated high number of casualties , of the war produced an entirely new <unk> towards the commemoration of war dead .
<unk> to World War I , individual commemoration of war dead was often on an <unk> <unk> basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers .
However , the war required &lt; unk &gt; of a significant percentage of the population , either as volunteers or through <unk> .
An <unk> had <unk> <unk> that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated , even if they were low @ - @ <unk> members of the military .
A committee under &lt; unk &gt; Kenyon , Director of the British Museum , presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 <unk> how it envisioned the development of the &lt; unk &gt; .
Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be <unk> and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> of returning home so many <unk> , it was felt that <unk> would conflict with the feeling of &lt; unk &gt; that had developed between serving <unk> .
An article in The Times on 17 February <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; Kipling carried the Commission &apos; s proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like .
The article entitled War Graves : <unk> of Imperial Commission : Mr. Kipling &apos; s <unk> was quickly <unk> as an <unk> <unk> , Graves of the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> was intended to &lt; unk &gt; the impact of Kenyon &apos; s report as it included <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; with mature trees and <unk> ; <unk> the <unk> <unk> depicted in published <unk> <unk> .
There was an immediate public &lt; unk &gt; following the publication of the reports , particularly with <unk> to the decision to not &lt; unk &gt; the bodies of the dead .
The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a <unk> debate in <unk> on 4 May 1920 .
Sir James &lt; unk &gt; started the debate , followed by <unk> by William &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; in favour of the Commission &apos; s principles and Robert <unk> speaking for those &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and opposing &lt; unk &gt; of grave markers .

&lt; unk &gt; withdrew his motion , allowing the Commission to carry out its work <unk> of support for its principles .
= = = First &lt; unk &gt; and memorials to the missing = = = Three of the most <unk> architects of their day , Sir <unk> <unk> , Sir <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , and Sir Edwin &lt; unk &gt; were commissioned to design the &lt; unk &gt; and memorials .
&lt; unk &gt; Kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial <unk> .
In 1920 , the Commission built three <unk> &lt; unk &gt; at <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , following the principles <unk> in the Kenyon report .
Of these , the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Cemetery and &lt; unk &gt; was agreed to be the most successful .
<unk> <unk> with garden designer <unk> <unk> , the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform &lt; unk &gt; in a garden setting , <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Cross of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &apos; Stone of Remembrance .
After some <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; became the <unk> for the Commission &apos; s building programme .
&lt; unk &gt; were required because all three <unk> &lt; unk &gt; went over budget .
To ensure future &lt; unk &gt; remained within their budget the Commission decided to not build <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; that contained less than 200 graves , to not place a Stone of Remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves , and to <unk> the height of cemetery walls to 1 metre ( 3 @ .
@ 3 ft ) .
At the end of <unk> , the Commission had spent £ 7 @ , @ 500 , and this figure rose to £ 250 @ , @ 000 in 1920 as construction of &lt; unk &gt; and memorials increased .
By 1921 , the Commission had established 1 @ , @ 000 &lt; unk &gt; which were ready for &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , and <unk> .
Between 1920 and 1923 , the Commission was shipping 4 @ , @ 000 &lt; unk &gt; a week to France .
In many cases small &lt; unk &gt; were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones .
By 1927 , when the majority of construction had been completed , over 500 &lt; unk &gt; had been built , with 400 @ , @ 000 &lt; unk &gt; , a thousand <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , and 400 <unk> of Remembrance .
The Commission had also been <unk> to <unk> commemorate each soldier who had no known grave , which amounted to <unk> @ , @ 000 in France and Belgium alone .
The Commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing ; each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the Western Front .
After resistance from the French committee responsible for the &lt; unk &gt; of memorials on French territory , the Commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials , and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing &lt; unk &gt; rather than as separate structures .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; Gate was the first memorial to the missing located in Europe to be completed , and was <unk> on 24 July 1927 .
The &lt; unk &gt; Gate ( &lt; unk &gt; ) was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; names of the missing were instead <unk> on <unk> <unk> &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Memorial to the <unk> .
Other memorials followed : the <unk> Memorial in <unk> designed by John James &lt; unk &gt; ; the &lt; unk &gt; Memorial on the <unk> and the &lt; unk &gt; Memorial designed by Edwin &lt; unk &gt; ; and the <unk> Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward &lt; unk &gt; Warren .
The &lt; unk &gt; and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing : the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Memorial for the forces of India , the &lt; unk &gt; Memorial by Canada , the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Memorial by Australia , the &lt; unk &gt; Wood Memorial by South Africa and the <unk> @ - @ <unk> Memorial by <unk> .
The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; Memorial in <unk> , though the &lt; unk &gt; Memorial would not be finished until <unk> , the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Memorial until 1938 and &lt; unk &gt; were still <unk> work on the &lt; unk &gt; Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940 .
The only memorial created by the Commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the &lt; unk &gt; Institute at &lt; unk &gt; , Egypt — complete with library , and &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> <unk> — as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and <unk> <unk> Corps .
Its <unk> was agreed with local political pressure .
= = = World War II = = = From the start of the Second World War in 1939 , the Commission organised grave <unk> units and , planning ahead based on the experience gained from the First World War , <unk> land for use as &lt; unk &gt; .
When the war began turning in favour of the <unk> , the Commission was able to begin <unk> its First World War &lt; unk &gt; and memorials .
It also began the task of commemorating the 600 @ , @ 000 Commonwealth casualties from the Second World War .
In 1949 , the Commission completed &lt; unk &gt; Canadian War Cemetery , the first of &lt; unk &gt; new &lt; unk &gt; and 36 new memorials .

Many were made from &lt; unk &gt; Wood stone .
The wider scale of World War II , <unk> with <unk> <unk> and unrest in some countries , meant that the construction and <unk> <unk> took much longer .
Following the war , the Commission implemented a five @ - @ year &lt; unk &gt; <unk> programme .
The &lt; unk &gt; <unk> was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary <unk> repairs to be made .
These , together with the &lt; unk &gt; of maintenance <unk> from before the war , took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s .
With the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the World War I , <unk> Churchill agreed to Ware &apos; s proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths .
A <unk> <unk> was added to the Imperial War Graves Commission &apos; s charter on 7 February 1941 , &lt; unk &gt; the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War , which resulted in the <unk> of the <unk> War Dead <unk> of <unk> .
The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67 @ , @ 000 civilians .
The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in Westminster <unk> but not until the roll was complete and <unk> had ended .

The Assistant Architects were : George &lt; unk &gt; Gordon &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> von <unk> , Charles Henry <unk> ( who in 1920 became a Principal &lt; unk &gt; ) , William <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , William &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , George <unk> <unk> , Frank &lt; unk &gt; , Arthur James Scott <unk> , <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , and John <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .

This makes the &lt; unk &gt; easily <unk> and <unk> them from war graves administered by other groups or countries .
A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or <unk> and with a wrought @ - @ iron <unk> entrance .
For &lt; unk &gt; in France and Belgium , a land &lt; unk &gt; near the entrance or along a wall <unk> the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or <unk> <unk> .
All but the smallest &lt; unk &gt; contain a <unk> with an <unk> of the <unk> , a plan of the <unk> and rows , and a <unk> history of the cemetery .
The <unk> is located within a metal <unk> that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a <unk> within the cemetery .
More recently , in larger sites , a <unk> steel <unk> gives details of the respective military campaign .
The &lt; unk &gt; within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark <unk> of equal size .
The cemetery grounds are , except in <unk> <unk> , <unk> covered with a <unk> border around the &lt; unk &gt; .
There is also an absence of any <unk> between the &lt; unk &gt; rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where <unk> could experience a sense of peace .

This cross was designed to <unk> <unk> crosses found in &lt; unk &gt; in England with <unk> more commonly seen in the <unk> cross .
The cross is normally a &lt; unk &gt; four @ - @ point <unk> Latin cross , mounted on an <unk> base , and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet .
A bronze &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> down , is <unk> on the face of the cross .
This cross represents the <unk> of the majority of the dead and the <unk> represents the military character of the cemetery , intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self @ - @ <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; with more than 1000 <unk> typically have a Stone of Remembrance , designed by Edwin &lt; unk &gt; with the <unk> &quot; Their <unk> &lt; unk &gt; for &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
The concept of the Stone of Remembrance stone was developed by &lt; unk &gt; Kipling to commemorate those of all <unk> and none respectively .
In contrast to the Cross of &lt; unk &gt; , the design for the stone deliberately avoided &quot; <unk> associated with particular <unk> &quot; .
The <unk> of the structure was based on studies of the &lt; unk &gt; .
Each stone is 3 @ .
@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) long and 1 @ .
@ 5 metres ( 4 @ .
@ 9 ft ) high .
The shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a <unk> and an <unk> .
The feature was designed using the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; .
The subtle <unk> in the design , if extended , would form a <unk> 1 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; feet 8 inches ( &lt; unk &gt; @ .

The &lt; unk &gt; , developed by &lt; unk &gt; Kipling , that appears on the graves of <unk> soldiers for which no details are known is &quot; A <unk> of the Great War known &lt; unk &gt; God &quot; .
Some &lt; unk &gt; <unk> the text &quot; believed to be buried in this cemetery &quot; when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known .
In some cases soldiers were buried in <unk> graves and <unk> one body from another was not possible and thus one &lt; unk &gt; covers more than one grave .
The &lt; unk &gt; does not <unk> any specific details of the death except for its date , and even then only if it is known , and are deliberately <unk> about the cause of death .
Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the Commission to <unk> from its standard design .
In places <unk> to extreme weather or earthquakes , such as <unk> and <unk> , stone @ - @ faced <unk> markers are used instead of the normal &lt; unk &gt; .
These measures are intended to prevent <unk> being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into &lt; unk &gt; ground .
In Italy &lt; unk &gt; were carved from &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> because it was in more <unk> supply .
In &lt; unk &gt; Military Cemetery , in Greece , to avoid risk of earthquake damage , small &lt; unk &gt; are laid flat on the ground .

The process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down <unk> .
Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Type &lt; unk &gt; I boats <unk> for service with the Flanders Flotilla made a five @ - @ day journey to <unk> for the &lt; unk &gt; to three @ - @ week assembly process .
After assembly at <unk> the boats were <unk> by <unk> to <unk> for trials .

The total time from departure of the &lt; unk &gt; from the <unk> to operational <unk> for the boats was about six weeks .
By July 1915 all seventeen of the German Imperial Navy Type &lt; unk &gt; Is had been completed .

According to <unk> R.

In @ - @ service use revealed another problem : with a single propeller <unk> / engine combination , if either component failed , the U @ - @ boat was almost <unk> disabled .
Another reported problem with the Type &lt; unk &gt; Is was the <unk> to break <unk> after the firing of torpedoes .
The boats were equipped with &lt; unk &gt; tanks designed to flood and <unk> the loss of the C / 06 torpedo &apos; s 1 @ , @ 700 @ - @ pound ( 770 kg ) weight , but this system did not always <unk> <unk> ; as a result , when firing from &lt; unk &gt; depth the boat could &lt; unk &gt; after firing or , if too much weight was taken on , &lt; unk &gt; to the <unk> .
When &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ 15 <unk> and sank Italian submarine &lt; unk &gt; in June 1915 , the tank failed to <unk> <unk> , forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Despite the problems , the &quot; tin &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , as the Germans referred to them , were in active service from March 1915 through the end of the war , with half of the 20 boats lost during the war .

During World War II , Gibraltar served a vital role in both the Atlantic Theatre and the Mediterranean Theatre , controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean .
In addition to its commanding position , Gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean .

During the course of the war , Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from &lt; unk &gt; French aircraft and from aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force ( <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ) based on <unk> .
Additionally , the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the Italian Royal Navy ( <unk> <unk> ) <unk> &lt; unk &gt; unit ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) and their human torpedoes .
This Italian unit was based on the interned Italian ship <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in the nearby Spanish harbour of &lt; unk &gt; .

The attack , during which 1 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; French sailors died , led to high tensions , which were evident when families were forced at <unk> point by French troops to board taking only what they could carry , leaving many <unk> behind .
However , when they arrived at Gibraltar , the Governor would not allow them to land , <unk> that once the &lt; unk &gt; were back on the Rock , it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time .

&lt; unk &gt; , trained and equipped by the Germans , the &lt; unk &gt; sank the armed <unk> &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and destroyed the auxiliary <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , which resulted in the deaths of six British &lt; unk &gt; on 18 January 1942 .
&lt; unk &gt; was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> <unk> Hume , who allowed him to beach a &lt; unk &gt; there .
The British intelligence was able however to <unk> the sabotage operations .
In March 1942 , a &lt; unk &gt; , José Key , one of the most prominent agents working for the Germans , responsible for the collection of information on military <unk> for the &lt; unk &gt; was arrested and executed in &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in late 1942 .
By September 1942 , &lt; unk &gt; , whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time , resigned and left Carlos &lt; unk &gt; , his second in command , in charge of the operations .
In late 1942 , the German headquarters in <unk> ordered the sabotage operations being expanded .
In early 1943 , the arrival of an experienced head of &lt; unk &gt; operations in Spain improved the <unk> of the operations .
In March 1943 an ammunition <unk> was blown up by &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s agents .
The British , growing <unk> of some of the &lt; unk &gt; , banned them from entering Gibraltar .
This forced the &lt; unk &gt; to ask &lt; unk &gt; for new personnel .
A &lt; unk &gt; working on the Rock , José <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , was responsible for the explosion and fire at a large fuel tank at &lt; unk &gt; Island on 30 June 1943 ; this mission , however , would be the first and the last for &lt; unk &gt; , because he was <unk> and arrested by British authorities in August , when he tried to <unk> a bomb into a weapons magazine inside &lt; unk &gt; Staff <unk> .
After being <unk> to death , he was <unk> on 11 January 1944 in Gibraltar by British <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
A member of an <unk> &lt; unk &gt; sabotage network , <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ( also arrested in 1943 ) was executed by &lt; unk &gt; on the same day .
&lt; unk &gt; himself was put under <unk> by the Spanish police and &lt; unk &gt; .
He would be a free man again in December , when he <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> , under direct orders of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , head of the sabotage section in Spain .
After a &lt; unk &gt; attempt against the life of pro @ - @ <unk> General José <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; network &apos; s agent Juan José &lt; unk &gt; and a meeting between Anthony <unk> and the Spanish ambassador at London , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> @ - @ James Stuart , &lt; unk &gt; activities around Gibraltar came to an end .
= = Operation &lt; unk &gt; : 1941 – 1942 = = Operation &lt; unk &gt; was a top @ - @ secret British stay @ - @ behind &lt; unk &gt; mission that was only to be implemented if Gibraltar was captured by the <unk> <unk> .
Six men were to be <unk> in a <unk> and left with only enough supplies for a year .
The volunteers — two <unk> , three &lt; unk &gt; and their leader — would run an observation post with one 12 @ - @ inch ( 300 mm ) by 6 @ - @ inch ( 150 mm ) <unk> looking over the harbour and a <unk> <unk> <unk> over the Mediterranean .
The team would then <unk> back all shipping <unk> to the British Admiralty .
They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the <unk> would have to be <unk> and <unk> into the <unk> floor .
Only if Germany was defeated within their first year would they be released .
As the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late 1941 , an idea for a series of secret observation posts ( first in Gibraltar and later in other places like <unk> and <unk> ) was put together under Operation &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and his chief engineer Colonel <unk> .
The site chosen at Lord &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing &lt; unk &gt; scheme for a <unk> .
<unk> trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of <unk> radio <unk> Colonel Richard <unk> @ - @ <unk> .
<unk> thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and <unk> task .
A member of Scott ’ s ill @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> to the <unk> , George Murray &lt; unk &gt; was called up as <unk> @ - @ Commander to <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
There were practical <unk> such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and clothing to consider as well as vital &quot; <unk> of the personnel &quot; .
The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their <unk> fully equipped and ready for occupation .
A <unk> <unk> was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret <unk> posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars .
However , Operation &lt; unk &gt; was never needed , as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front .
The operation had been &lt; unk &gt; in mystery until the discovery of <unk> at the Public <unk> Office in &lt; unk &gt; UK .
<unk> in the 1960s , details of the story were told to a <unk> by his intelligence service <unk> and he wrote these up as &quot; Operation <unk> &quot; , yet <unk> were very <unk> .
In 1997 &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; ( as it was <unk> ) was discovered in Gibraltar by the Gibraltar &lt; unk &gt; Group , but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission .
The discovery came about when the group encountered a strong <unk> of wind in a <unk> .
Further <unk> led them to break through a wall into <unk> which had never been used and had remained <unk> for over 50 years .
In November 2006 Jim &lt; unk &gt; and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson , senior <unk> <unk> with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , met possibly the only member of Operation &lt; unk &gt; still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England .
Cooper , 92 at the time , provided an opportunity to <unk> light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a <unk> @ - @ Lieutenant in the Royal Navy <unk> <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
He recalled stories about his <unk> , his training , and his feelings about the task .

An invasion of Europe in 1943 would be &lt; unk &gt; , but the allies could attack the &quot; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of Europe &quot; through the Mediterranean , as Prime Minister <unk> Churchill put it .
&lt; unk &gt; by President <unk> <unk> and Churchill and <unk> named Operation &lt; unk &gt; , the plan was to <unk> French North Africa : Morocco , <unk> , and <unk> .
From these French <unk> , attacks could be launched that would drive Italy out of the war .
In July 1942 , Lieutenant General <unk> D. Eisenhower was appointed Allied Commander @ - @ in @ - @ Chief of Operation &lt; unk &gt; .
Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this , the first large @ - @ scale <unk> @ - @ American operation of the war .
He arrived in Gibraltar on 5 November 1942 to take over , not just command of Operation &lt; unk &gt; itself , but also military command of Gibraltar .
General Eisenhower stayed at The &lt; unk &gt; , the official Governor &apos; s residence , but his operational headquarters were in a small <unk> in a <unk> in the heart of the Rock .
In his <unk> General Eisenhower wrote : The <unk> <unk> under the Rock provided the sole available office space , and in them was located the <unk> equipment by which we expected to keep in <unk> with the commanders of the three assault forces .
The <unk> darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; electric <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; , cold air in block @ - @ long <unk> was heavy with <unk> and did not <unk> <unk> to the &lt; unk &gt; efforts of electric fans .

One hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a <unk> of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; on Gibraltar .
More than 400 aircraft of all types were &lt; unk &gt; into the <unk> areas around the Gibraltar runway .

On 8 November 1942 , &lt; unk &gt; aircraft from Gibraltar landed on captured North African <unk> .
From their headquarters in Gibraltar , General Eisenhower and Admiral Sir Andrew <unk> <unk> directed Operation &lt; unk &gt; , the first major combined combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces .
= = = War tunnels = = = <unk> that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences <unk> it , the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and <unk> inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar .
This &quot; town &quot; inside the Rock contained its own power station , water supply , and hospital .
Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end .
Two Canadian engineer companies , the only soldiers with <unk> @ - @ <unk> <unk> and 5 British engineer companies , added some 30 miles ( 48 km ) of such tunnels , a feat thought impossible at the time .
That was enough to hold all 30 @ , @ 000 troops on the rock .
Today , the rock has more <unk> tunnels than roads .

On board was General <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Prime Minister of <unk> &apos; s London @ - @ based government in <unk> and Commander @ - @ in @ - @ Chief of its armed forces , returning from <unk> Polish troops in the Middle East .
The aircraft <unk> normally from the runway , <unk> off to <unk> speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour .
The 62 @ - @ year @ - @ old general died , along with 15 others .
The sole <unk> was the <unk> @ - @ born <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , who was rescued by an RAF launch .

The <unk> of General &lt; unk &gt; and his Chief @ - @ of @ - @ Staff , General &lt; unk &gt; , were <unk> in the Polish National <unk> and lay in state in the Cathedral of St. Mary the &lt; unk &gt; .

A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to &lt; unk &gt; aircraft controls .
Despite this finding , the political context of the event , <unk> with a variety of <unk> circumstances , immediately gave rise to speculation that &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s death had been no accident , and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet , British or even Polish conspiracy .
= = Aftermath = = The <unk> of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible <unk> to the return of the &lt; unk &gt; to the Rock .
As a result , a &lt; unk &gt; Board was established in November , and at a meeting of the Board on 8 February 1944 <unk> <unk> were finally agreed .
On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1 @ , @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May , the first <unk> party left <unk> , and by the end of 1944 only <unk> non @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; remained on the island .

&lt; unk &gt; became Emperor at the age of sixty @ - @ five , after a <unk> of imperial service under &lt; unk &gt; and the rulers of the &lt; unk &gt; dynasty .
Under &lt; unk &gt; , he was a member of the imperial <unk> and played a vital part in <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; conspiracy of 65 .
Later , as a <unk> to the &lt; unk &gt; , he attained &lt; unk &gt; in 71 and 90 during the &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; respectively .
On 18 September 96 , &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> in a palace conspiracy involving members of the &lt; unk &gt; Guard and several of his freedmen .
On the same day , &lt; unk &gt; was declared emperor by the Roman Senate .
This was the first time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor .
As the new ruler of the Roman Empire , he <unk> to restore <unk> which had been <unk> during the &lt; unk &gt; government of &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s brief reign was <unk> by financial difficulties and his <unk> to <unk> his authority over the Roman army .
A revolt by the &lt; unk &gt; Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir .
After some &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; adopted Trajan , a young and popular general , as his successor .
After <unk> fifteen months in office , &lt; unk &gt; died of natural causes on 27 January 98 .
Upon his death he was succeeded and <unk> by Trajan .
Although much of his life remains <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; was considered a <unk> and moderate emperor by ancient historians .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death , thus <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; – &lt; unk &gt; dynasty .

Ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 35 .
He had at least one <unk> sister , named &lt; unk &gt; , who married Lucius &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the brother of the future Emperor &lt; unk &gt; .
Like &lt; unk &gt; , the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; dynasty , &lt; unk &gt; was a member of the Italian <unk> rather than one of the elite of Rome .
Nevertheless , the &lt; unk &gt; were among the most <unk> and prominent political families of the late Republic and early Empire , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in each <unk> generation .
The direct ancestors of &lt; unk &gt; on his father &apos; s side , all named Marcus &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , were associated with imperial <unk> since the time of Emperor Augustus ( 27 BC – AD 14 ) .
His great @ - @ <unk> was <unk> in 36 BC ( in replacement , and <unk> ) , and Governor of Asia in the same year .
His <unk> became <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in July of either 21 or 22 , and was known as a personal friend of Emperor &lt; unk &gt; ( AD 14 – 37 ) , <unk> the emperor during his voluntary <unk> on <unk> from 23 onwards , <unk> in 33 .

He was &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ <unk> in the year 65 and , like his ancestors , moved in imperial <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
As an advisor to Emperor &lt; unk &gt; , he successfully helped <unk> and <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; conspiracy of 65 .
&lt; unk &gt; what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable , since they earned him <unk> equal to those of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s guard <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
He received &lt; unk &gt; honors — which was usually <unk> for military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace .
According to the contemporary poet <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; also held &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s literary <unk> in high <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; him as the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; of our time &quot; .
Another prominent member of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> was &lt; unk &gt; , an old and respected general who had celebrated military &lt; unk &gt; during the <unk> .
It appears &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; during his time as an imperial advisor , and may have asked him to <unk> over &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s youngest son &lt; unk &gt; when &lt; unk &gt; departed for the Jewish war in 67 .
The suicide of &lt; unk &gt; on 9 June 68 brought the Julio @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; dynasty to an end , leading to the <unk> Year of the Four &lt; unk &gt; , which saw the <unk> rise and fall of the emperors &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , until the accession of &lt; unk &gt; on 21 December 69 .
&lt; unk &gt; nothing is known of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> during 69 , but despite the fact that &lt; unk &gt; was his brother @ - @ in @ - @ law , he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; .
For services unknown , he was <unk> with a &lt; unk &gt; early in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s reign in 71 .
This was a remarkable honour , not only because he held this office early under the new <unk> , but also because it was an ordinary &lt; unk &gt; ( instead of a less <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) , making him one of the few non @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; to be <unk> in this way under &lt; unk &gt; .

Despite his political experience , this was a remarkable choice .
&lt; unk &gt; was old and &lt; unk &gt; , and had spent much of his career out of the public light , <unk> both ancient and modern <unk> to <unk> on his involvement in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> .
According to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the conspirators approached &lt; unk &gt; as a potential successor prior to the <unk> , which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot .
&lt; unk &gt; by contrast does not <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , but he may have <unk> his role out of &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> the works of &lt; unk &gt; were published under &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s direct descendants Trajan and &lt; unk &gt; , it would have been less than <unk> of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder .
On the other hand , &lt; unk &gt; lacked widespread support in the Empire , and as a known &lt; unk &gt; <unk> his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators .
The <unk> <unk> have been <unk> by history , but modern historians believe &lt; unk &gt; was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , within hours after the news of the <unk> broke .
Although he appeared to be an <unk> candidate on account of his age and weak health , &lt; unk &gt; was considered a <unk> choice <unk> because he was old and &lt; unk &gt; .
Furthermore , he had close connections with the &lt; unk &gt; dynasty and commanded the <unk> of a substantial part of the Senate .
&lt; unk &gt; had seen the <unk> which had resulted from the death of &lt; unk &gt; ; he knew that to &lt; unk &gt; even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict .
<unk> than decline the <unk> and risk &lt; unk &gt; , he accepted .
The decision may have been <unk> so as to avoid civil war , but neither the Senate nor &lt; unk &gt; appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against &lt; unk &gt; .
Following the accession of &lt; unk &gt; as emperor , the Senate passed &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; on &lt; unk &gt; : his <unk> and statues were <unk> , his <unk> were <unk> down and his name was <unk> from all public records .
In many <unk> , existing portraits of &lt; unk &gt; , such as those found on the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , were simply &lt; unk &gt; to fit the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; .
This allowed quick production of new images and <unk> of previous material .
In addition , the <unk> palace which &lt; unk &gt; had erected on the &lt; unk &gt; Hill , known as the &lt; unk &gt; Palace , was renamed the &quot; House of the People &quot; , and &lt; unk &gt; himself took up residence in &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s former villa in the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; .

All properties which had been <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; were returned to their respective families .
&lt; unk &gt; also sought to <unk> the Senate in his government , but this was not entirely successful .
He continued to <unk> largely on friends and <unk> that were known and <unk> , and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of the Senate , he <unk> <unk> which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life .

As was <unk> by this time , a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and money to the people and the army .
Accordingly , a &lt; unk &gt; of 75 &lt; unk &gt; per head was <unk> upon the <unk> , while the soldiers of the &lt; unk &gt; Guard received a &lt; unk &gt; which may have amounted to as much as <unk> &lt; unk &gt; per person .
This was followed by a <unk> of economic <unk> intended to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> from the most &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
To the <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; granted &lt; unk &gt; of land worth up to 60 million &lt; unk &gt; .
He &lt; unk &gt; parents and their children from a 5 % <unk> tax , and he made <unk> to Italian <unk> on the condition that they pay interest of 5 % to their <unk> to support the children of &lt; unk &gt; families ; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> which were later expanded by Trajan , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and Marcus <unk> .
Furthermore , numerous <unk> were &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> granted to Roman provinces .
&lt; unk &gt; , he probably <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay : some of his <unk> <unk> the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> the Jewish tax ) .

Because he <unk> only briefly , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s public works were few , instead <unk> projects which had been initiated under &lt; unk &gt; rule .
This included extensive repairs to the Roman road system and the expansion of the &lt; unk &gt; .
The latter program was headed by the former consul &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , who helped to put an end to <unk> and later published a significant work on Rome &apos; s water supply , De &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The only major <unk> constructed under &lt; unk &gt; were a &lt; unk &gt; , known as the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , and a small Imperial &lt; unk &gt; begun by &lt; unk &gt; , which <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; of Augustus to the Temple of <unk> .
Little remains , partly because the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> across it .
= = = <unk> of <unk> = = = Despite &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s measures to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people , support for &lt; unk &gt; remained strong in the army , which had called for his &lt; unk &gt; immediately after the <unk> .
In an attempt to <unk> the soldiers of the &lt; unk &gt; Guard , &lt; unk &gt; had dismissed their <unk> Titus &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; — one of the chief conspirators against &lt; unk &gt; — and replaced him with a former commander , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Likewise , the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; <unk> upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to <unk> <unk> any <unk> against the violent <unk> change .
The &lt; unk &gt; considered these measures insufficient , however , and demanded the execution of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> , which &lt; unk &gt; refused .
<unk> <unk> with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the &lt; unk &gt; crisis of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s reign .
While the <unk> transfer of power following &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s death had prevented a civil war from &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable , and his <unk> nature turned into a <unk> to <unk> his authority .
Upon his accession , he had ordered a <unk> to <unk> trials , but at the same time allowed the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; by the Senate to continue .
This measure led to <unk> , as <unk> <unk> in his own <unk> while trying to settle <unk> with personal enemies , leading the consul &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> <unk> that &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; was ultimately &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> .
Early in 97 , a conspiracy led by the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; failed , but once again &lt; unk &gt; refused to put the conspirators to death , much to the <unk> of the Senate .
The situation was further <unk> by the absence of a clear successor , made more <unk> because of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s old age and <unk> .
He had no natural children of his own and only <unk> relatives , who were <unk> for political office .
A successor would have to be chosen from among the <unk> or <unk> in the Empire and it appears that , by 97 , &lt; unk &gt; was considering to adopt Marcus <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the powerful governor of <unk> .
This was <unk> opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , commonly known as Trajan , a general of the armies at the German <unk> .
In October 97 these tensions came to a head when the &lt; unk &gt; Guard , led by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , laid <unk> to the Imperial Palace and took &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
He was forced to <unk> to their demands , <unk> to hand over those responsible for &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s death and even giving a speech &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Titus &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s former &lt; unk &gt; , were sought out and killed .
&lt; unk &gt; was <unk> in this assault , but his authority was damaged beyond repair .
He realized that his position was no longer &lt; unk &gt; without the support of an heir who had the <unk> of both the army and the people .
Shortly <unk> , he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor , and with this decision all but <unk> .
Trajan was formally <unk> with the title of Caesar and shared the &lt; unk &gt; with &lt; unk &gt; in 98 : <unk> to the view here <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , however , &lt; unk &gt; had in fact little choice with <unk> to his successor .
<unk> with a major crisis , he <unk> needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation .
The only candidate with sufficient military experience , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and connections was Trajan .
Likewise , Edward &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> that &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; established a tradition of <unk> through adoption among the Five Good &lt; unk &gt; has found little support among modern historians .
= = <unk> and legacy = = On 1 January , 98 , at the start of his fourth &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; suffered a <unk> during a private audience .
Shortly <unk> he was struck by a <unk> and died at his villa in the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , on 28 January .
He was <unk> by the Senate , and his <unk> were laid to rest in the &lt; unk &gt; of Augustus .
&lt; unk &gt; was succeeded without incident by his adopted son Trajan , who was <unk> by the Roman <unk> with much <unk> .
According to Pliny the <unk> , Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of &lt; unk &gt; , yet no <unk> of it has ever been found ; nor was a <unk> series of <unk> for the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; issued until ten years after his death .
According to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , however , the Guard <unk> responsible for the <unk> against &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , was &apos; dismissed &apos; upon Trajan &apos; s accession .
Due to the lack of written sources on this period , much of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s life has remained <unk> .
The most substantial surviving account of the reign of &lt; unk &gt; was written by the 3rd @ - @ century historian &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
His Roman History , which <unk> nearly a <unk> , from the arrival of &lt; unk &gt; in Italy until the year &lt; unk &gt; , was composed more than one hundred years after &lt; unk &gt; had died .
Further details are added by an <unk> <unk> from the &lt; unk &gt; de &lt; unk &gt; , a work alleged to have been <unk> by the 4th @ - @ century historian <unk> Victor .
A more <unk> text , <unk> to describe the life of &lt; unk &gt; in closer detail , is the &lt; unk &gt; , by the contemporary historian &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; is an account of the history of Rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor &lt; unk &gt; in 69 until the death of &lt; unk &gt; in 96 .
<unk> , a substantial part of the work has been lost , with only the first five books covering the Year of the Four &lt; unk &gt; remaining .
In the introduction to his <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; however , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> highly of &lt; unk &gt; , describing his reign as &quot; the dawn of a most happy age , &#91; when &#93; &lt; unk &gt; Caesar <unk> things once &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> and freedom &quot; .
The surviving histories speak equally <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s brief reign , although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies .
Both &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> Victor <unk> his <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; , with &lt; unk &gt; <unk> his decision to adopt Trajan as his heir .
These views were later <unk> by the <unk> @ - @ century historian Edward &lt; unk &gt; in his History of the <unk> and <unk> of the Roman Empire .
&lt; unk &gt; considered &lt; unk &gt; the first of the Five Good &lt; unk &gt; , five <unk> rulers under whom the Roman Empire &quot; was <unk> by <unk> power , under the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> &quot; from 96 until 180 .
Nevertheless , even &lt; unk &gt; notes that , compared to his <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; may have lacked the necessary <unk> for a successful reign : Modern history has expanded upon this <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; as a well @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; but weak and &lt; unk &gt; ruler .
The Roman Senate enjoyed <unk> <unk> under his rule , but &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; of the state <unk> and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a significant crisis .
The <unk> led by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was never intended as a <unk> , but a <unk> attempt to put pressure on the emperor .
The adoption of Trajan expanded his power base with a respected , <unk> general as his successor .
&lt; unk &gt; concludes that &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s real <unk> were in fact ill @ - @ suited to the &lt; unk &gt; : His place in Roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary , if <unk> stop @ - @ <unk> before the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
It is a fact of <unk> that even the only major public work completed during his reign , the &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; , ultimately became known as the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , or <unk> <unk> .
Two modern statues which commemorate &lt; unk &gt; can be found in towns associated with him .
There is an &lt; unk &gt; statue in <unk> , England , a town which was founded in his honour .

Despite the change in emphasis , &lt; unk &gt; still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie &apos; s character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah , through the positioning of the characters in the frame .
For example , when Eddie is playing &lt; unk &gt; , Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above &lt; unk &gt; while still below Bert in a three shot .
When Sarah enters the room , she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert .

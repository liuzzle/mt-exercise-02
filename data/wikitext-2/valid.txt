= Homarus gammarus = Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of &lt; unk &gt; lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea .
It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus .
It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 <unk> ( 13 <unk> ) , and bears a <unk> pair of claws .
In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming &quot; lobster red &quot; on <unk> .
<unk> occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the <unk> for up to a year before <unk> into &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Homarus gammarus is a highly <unk> food , and is widely caught using lobster <unk> , mostly around the British Isles .
= = Description = = Homarus gammarus is a large &lt; unk &gt; , with a body length up to 60 <unk> ( 24 in ) and <unk> up to 5 – 6 <unk> ( 11 – 13 <unk> ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster <unk> are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and <unk> 0 @ .
@ 7 – 2 @ .
@ 2 kg ( 1 @ .
@ 5 – 4 @ .
@ 9 <unk> ) .
Like other <unk> , lobsters have a hard &lt; unk &gt; which they must <unk> in order to grow , in a process called &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but <unk> to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals .
The first pair of &lt; unk &gt; is armed with a large , <unk> pair of claws .
The larger one is the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , and has <unk> &lt; unk &gt; used for <unk> <unk> ; the other is the &quot; <unk> &quot; , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> , the left <unk> is the &lt; unk &gt; , and the right is the <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; is generally blue above , with <unk> that &lt; unk &gt; , and yellow below .
The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after <unk> .
This occurs because , in life , the red <unk> &lt; unk &gt; is bound to a <unk> complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of <unk> , <unk> the red <unk> .
The closest <unk> of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus .
The two species are very similar , and can be crossed <unk> , although <unk> are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not <unk> .
The two species can be <unk> by a number of characteristics : The &lt; unk &gt; of H. americanus bears one or more <unk> on the <unk> , which are <unk> in H. gammarus .
The <unk> on the claws of H. americanus are red or red @ - @ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @ - @ tipped .
The <unk> of the <unk> of H. americanus is <unk> or red , while that of H. gammarus is <unk> white or very pale red .
= = Life <unk> = = <unk> H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have <unk> to a <unk> length of 80 – 85 <unk> ( 3 @ .
@ 1 – 3 @ .
@ 3 in ) , whereas <unk> <unk> at a slightly smaller size .
<unk> typically occurs in summer between a recently &lt; unk &gt; female , whose shell is therefore <unk> , and a hard @ - @ <unk> male .
The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> carrying eggs are said to be &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; and can be found throughout the year .
The eggs <unk> at night , and the <unk> <unk> to the water surface where they <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , <unk> on &lt; unk &gt; .
This stage involves three &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> for 15 – 35 days .
After the third <unk> , the <unk> takes on a form closer to the <unk> , and <unk> a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> seen in the wild , and are <unk> known , although they are known to be capable of <unk> extensive <unk> .
It is estimated that only 1 <unk> in every 20 @ , @ 000 survives to the &lt; unk &gt; phase .
When they reach a <unk> length of 15 mm ( 0 @ .
@ 59 in ) , the <unk> leave their <unk> and start their <unk> lives .
= = <unk> = = Homarus gammarus is found across the north @ - @ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the <unk> and Morocco , not including the <unk> Sea .
It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @ - @ west coast of the Black Sea .
The &lt; unk &gt; populations are found in the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , inside the <unk> Circle .
The species can be divided into four <unk> distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have <unk> due to small effective population <unk> , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment .
The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the &quot; <unk> @ - @ sun lobster &quot; .
The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean .
The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : <unk> from the &lt; unk &gt; were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel .
<unk> have been made to <unk> H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster <unk> were released from &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; , but the species did not become established there .
= = <unk> = = <unk> H. gammarus live on the <unk> <unk> at <unk> of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – &lt; unk &gt; ft ) , although not normally <unk> than 50 m ( 160 ft ) .
They <unk> hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in <unk> or <unk> , <unk> at night to <unk> .
The <unk> of H. gammarus mostly consists of other &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
These include <unk> , <unk> , sea &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> <unk> .
The three &lt; unk &gt; lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; are <unk> to the three known species of the animal &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described .
Homarus gammarus is <unk> to the disease &lt; unk &gt; , caused by the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out .
= = Human <unk> = = Homarus gammarus is <unk> &quot; highly <unk> &quot; as a &lt; unk &gt; and was mentioned in &quot; The &lt; unk &gt; &quot; a <unk> century English <unk> song .
It may <unk> very high <unk> and may be sold fresh , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
Both the claws and the <unk> of H. gammarus contain &quot; <unk> &quot; white <unk> , and most of the <unk> of the <unk> are edible .
The <unk> are the &lt; unk &gt; mill and the &quot; sand <unk> &quot; ( <unk> ) .
The <unk> of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; are mostly <unk> using lobster <unk> , although lines &lt; unk &gt; with &lt; unk &gt; or &lt; unk &gt; sometimes <unk> in <unk> them out , to allow them to be caught in a <unk> or by hand .
In 2008 , 4 @ , @ <unk> t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @ , @ <unk> t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) .
The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a <unk> length of 87 mm ( 3 @ .

&lt; unk &gt; <unk> for H. gammarus are under development , and production <unk> are still very low .
= = &lt; unk &gt; history = = Homarus gammarus was first given a <unk> name by <unk> <unk> in the tenth edition of his <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , published in <unk> .
That name was <unk> gammarus , since <unk> &apos; concept of the <unk> <unk> at that time included all large <unk> .
H. gammarus is the type species of the <unk> Homarus Weber , <unk> , as determined by <unk> 51 of the International Commission on <unk> <unk> .
Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , 1775 and Homarus <unk> H. Milne @ - @ Edwards , 1837 , and also because <unk> Weber &apos; s description of the <unk> had been overlooked until <unk> by Mary &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> any prior <unk> of type species ( for Homarus H.

The type <unk> of Homarus gammarus was a &lt; unk &gt; selected by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in 1974 .
It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of <unk> ) , but both it and the &lt; unk &gt; have since been lost .
The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> is &quot; European lobster &quot; , but the species is also widely known as the &quot; common lobster &quot; .

In the 16th century <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; and Hamburg were operating a summer trading <unk> to buy fish from the local fleet .
By the 18th century , two Scottish &lt; unk &gt; , Thomas &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; , and Arthur &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; , owned the island .
They maintained a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ( Old Norse : &apos; deep sea &apos; ) fishing industry , undertaken in the summer months using six @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; boats known as &lt; unk &gt; .
In addition to the &lt; unk &gt; colony on &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; there may have been another at &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .

In the 19th century the &lt; unk &gt; fishing station in West &lt; unk &gt; was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more .
However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam &lt; unk &gt; saw a fall in population from the <unk> on .
At this time another <unk> entered the history of Papa &lt; unk &gt; .

By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the &lt; unk &gt; and local volunteers ( there being no <unk> in Shetland at that time ) , weather conditions had <unk> to the point where it was impossible to approach the &lt; unk &gt; .
A request had been made for the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> from <unk> , only 120 miles away , to launch , but the request was made too late to be of help .
All 9 crew <unk> in the <unk> .
Only 3 bodies were recovered , that of James <unk> , which was returned to Aberdeen , and the bodies of J.

I thought , &apos; This has <unk> be some <unk> <unk> . &apos;
So when it came time to do the record , that <unk> was still in my head — that &apos; s where the lyrics to &apos; Angel of Death &apos; came from . &quot;
The lyrics <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> experiments on <unk> at the <unk> concentration camp during World War II .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; were conducted on such groups as <unk> and twins , and included both physical and psychological <unk> .

Just a matter of time &apos; &lt; unk &gt; you <unk> &lt; unk &gt; apart &quot; , a line from the <unk> verse , is a reference to the allegation &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; together twins , one of them <unk> ; &quot; the &lt; unk &gt; was &lt; unk &gt; to the other child , back to back , their <unk> back to back too . &quot;

The controversy led to accusations of Nazi &lt; unk &gt; which have followed Slayer throughout their career .
People took Hanneman &apos; s interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi <unk> as evidence of &lt; unk &gt; – his most <unk> <unk> being a German <unk> &apos; s Cross .
Hanneman &lt; unk &gt; <unk> : &quot; I know why people &lt; unk &gt; it – it &apos; s because they get this knee – &lt; unk &gt; reaction to it .
When they read the lyrics , there &apos; s nothing I put in the lyrics that says <unk> he was a bad man , because to me – well , <unk> &apos; t that obvious ?
I <unk> &apos; t have to tell you that . &quot;
According to guitarist <unk> King : &quot; <unk> , &apos; Slayer are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> &apos; — all that fun <unk> .
And of course we got the most &lt; unk &gt; for it in Germany .
I was always like , &apos; <unk> the lyrics and tell me what &apos; s offensive about it .
Can you see it as a documentary , or do you think Slayer &apos; s <unk> <unk> World War II ? &apos;
People get this thought in their heads — especially in Europe — and you &apos; ll never talk them out of it . &quot;

The $ <unk> million project was started in 2002 and completed in December 2005 .
It was designed by the &lt; unk &gt; Corporation and built by &lt; unk &gt; Construction Corporation .
The interchange is considered by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; to be one of &quot; The World &apos; s 18 &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; because of its height ( as high as a 12 @ - @ story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features .
In 2006 , the American Public Works Association named the High Five Interchange as &quot; Public Works &lt; unk &gt; of the Year &quot; .
= = Description = = The High Five Interchange , north of downtown in Dallas , Texas , is a massive five @ - @ level freeway interchange .
It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy <unk> hour traffic , the <unk> B. Johnson <unk> ( Interstate 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US 75 ) , and is the first five @ - @ level <unk> interchange to be built in the city .
It <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; three @ - @ level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe <unk> by <unk> US 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways .
The <unk> ramps of the cloverleaf forced <unk> to slow down <unk> , <unk> up traffic .
<unk> @ - @ hand exits contributed to the <unk> .
Further , its two <unk> roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult .
&lt; unk &gt; to the <unk> <unk> , the &quot; High Five &quot; name refers to the five <unk> ramps <unk> the left @ - @ turn movements that tower over the <unk> .
The interchange is as high as a 12 @ - @ story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the &quot; High Five &quot; ) , <unk> support <unk> , and 60 miles of additional highway .
The highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground .
The lanes of US 75 , which are on the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top As part of the project , I @ - @ 635 was <unk> to include four dedicated high @ - @ <unk> <unk> lanes ( &lt; unk &gt; lanes ) that are <unk> @ - @ separated and &lt; unk &gt; .
The roads on the five levels are : Level I : US 75 , an eight lane highway , four lanes going each way Level II : The junction of the two six @ - @ lane <unk> roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left @ - @ turn lanes and &lt; unk &gt; , and easy access to US 75 and I @ - @ 635 Level III : I @ - @ 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four &lt; unk &gt; lanes ( two going each way ) separated by <unk> Level IV and V : <unk> connection ramps ( two levels ) , <unk> the left exits of the modified cloverleaf The interchange , with its decorative &lt; unk &gt; on &lt; unk &gt; concrete elements , along with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the Texas Department of Transportation ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , can be <unk> as an <unk> work of public art .
The High Five also <unk> a hiking and <unk> trail , named the &lt; unk &gt; Trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange .
The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by &lt; unk &gt; .
The interchange is considered by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; as one of &quot; The World &apos; s 18 &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , calling it a &quot; <unk> of lanes &quot; and a &quot; five @ - @ level &lt; unk &gt; of engineering &quot; because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features .
= = History = = The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , &lt; unk &gt; interchange that <unk> 500 @ , @ 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most <unk> developed commercial zones in Dallas .
It was a <unk> project between the &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> <unk> and property owners , and the primary <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; Construction .
An essential <unk> was to complete the project with as little <unk> to the traffic flow as possible .
<unk> for <unk> the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce <unk> , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access .
&lt; unk &gt; Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ <unk> million contract by &lt; unk &gt; , the largest ever by that agency .
The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project <unk> .
For example , it <unk> the concrete maturity <unk> to be used to ensure the concrete &apos; s strength ( the first time &lt; unk &gt; had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a &lt; unk &gt; scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years .
Also built into the construction contract was a <unk> that &lt; unk &gt; was charged for &quot; lane <unk> &quot; by &lt; unk &gt; for time they closed down traffic lanes — <unk> based on &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and the time of day the lane was closed .
The <unk> <unk> from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @ , @ 000 for <unk> hours .
In order not to <unk> with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as <unk> <unk> ramps and &lt; unk &gt; so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed .
Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished .
To <unk> time and money , <unk> construction methods were employed : The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and <unk> ( used to direct @ - @ <unk> roads ) to be made of steel , but because building with steel would <unk> with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @ - @ in @ - @ place <unk> concrete was <unk> in the plans .
However , &lt; unk &gt; decided to use &lt; unk &gt; concrete <unk> bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of Italy and <unk> about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place .
During the construction , 2 @ .
@ 2 million <unk> yards of &lt; unk &gt; was used , 350 @ , @ 000 <unk> yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 300 @ , @ 000 square feet of <unk> walls were built .
Additionally , 40 @ , @ 000 feet of <unk> <unk> and 75 @ , @ 000 <unk> feet of <unk> pipe were completed .
In addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in 2 @ .

&lt; unk &gt; grazing in the &lt; unk &gt; Creek Mountains began in the late 19th century , and the &lt; unk &gt; currently &lt; unk &gt; grazing &lt; unk &gt; in the area .
&lt; unk &gt; can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months .
The effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s .
= = Land @ - @ management <unk> = = By the 1970s and 1980s , a century of <unk> cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the &lt; unk &gt; Creek Mountains and elsewhere in the Great Basin .
As a result , stream banks were <unk> and <unk> vegetation was <unk> into riparian zones .
&lt; unk &gt; populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , <unk> <unk> over streams and raising water <unk> .
These conditions put the rare &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; trout population at risk .
Since the &lt; unk &gt; was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began <unk> the <unk> of grazing <unk> in the &lt; unk &gt; Creek Mountains .
Beginning in the early 1970s , the Bureau of Land Management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural <unk> in those areas .
<unk> 20 @ , @ 000 &lt; unk &gt; trees were <unk> along streams , small <unk> were put together to create more <unk> in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing .
<unk> , the agency sought to <unk> land @ - @ use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project .
As <unk> <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; to close much of the &lt; unk &gt; Creek Mountains to grazing , <unk> ranchers joined the &lt; unk &gt; Rebellion seeking to protect their grazing &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce <unk> <unk> with <unk> potentially <unk> decades .
However , in 1988 , interest groups <unk> all sides of the issue joined to form the &lt; unk &gt; Creek Mountain <unk> Group .
The group &apos; s goal was to find a <unk> <unk> to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land &apos; s <unk> health and ranchers &apos; economic needs .
<unk> members of the &lt; unk &gt; Creek Mountain <unk> Group included : Over the next several years , the group continued to meet and <unk> <unk> for <unk> the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers .
<unk> were all open to the public .
The group eventually <unk> a grazing management plan that provided for both the <unk> health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well @ - @ being of ranchers .
In 1989 , the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> agreed to rest two grazing &lt; unk &gt; totaling 50 @ , @ 000 acres ( 20 @ , @ 000 ha ) to restore critical stream &lt; unk &gt; and mountain <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; on <unk> <unk> Creek was <unk> for three years , and its &lt; unk &gt; Creek <unk> received a five @ - @ year rest before grazing was resumed .
In addition , the grazing season in mountain <unk> was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the &lt; unk &gt; areas was reduced from 3 @ , @ 800 to 2 @ , @ 200 .
Finally , sensitive areas were &lt; unk &gt; to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams .
Other &lt; unk &gt; also agreed to rest specific <unk> including the &lt; unk &gt; Creek , &lt; unk &gt; Creek , and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
In 1991 , the Bureau of Land Management approved a new grazing &lt; unk &gt; management plan .
It was based on the <unk> made by the &lt; unk &gt; Creek Mountain <unk> Group , and it took effect in 1992 .
Since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the &lt; unk &gt; Creek Mountains has recovered , and studies by the United States <unk> and <unk> Service have found that the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; trout population , still listed as threatened , is also <unk> .

The chapel &apos; s original purpose is unknown , but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court , or as a chapel of <unk> in a large <unk> with a growing population .
It was used for a time until the early 18th century as a private place of <unk> for a nearby house , then later fell into <unk> .
The walls still remain , with some <unk> of <unk> on them <unk> , but there is no roof .
It contains a 16th @ - @ century side chapel with a vault beneath , used as a burial chamber .

This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north @ - @ west Wales were first built in stone following the end of <unk> raids and attempts by the &lt; unk &gt; to gain control of the island .
The reason for its construction , and the <unk> to whom it was dedicated , are unknown .

&lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , authors of a 2001 <unk> to ancient Anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and was perhaps intended to serving the <unk> population in medieval times .
Despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of <unk> rather than become a <unk> church in its own right .
The chapel is sometimes referred to as &quot; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; ( &quot; <unk> &quot; being the Welsh word for &quot; old &quot; and &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; meaning &quot; chapel &quot; ) .

In July 2014 the International <unk> Union launched a process for giving <unk> names to certain <unk> and their host stars .
The process involved public nomination and <unk> for the new names .

The planet is unlikely to have large <unk> , since &lt; unk &gt; forces would either &lt; unk &gt; them from <unk> or destroy them on short &lt; unk &gt; compared to the age of the system .

= = History = = The current route was originally <unk> in 1911 as part of the Delaware River Drive , a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from &lt; unk &gt; to the New York border in &lt; unk &gt; Township .
Route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from &lt; unk &gt; to Newark .
The original route ran from downtown &lt; unk &gt; along State Street and &lt; unk &gt; Drive .
From there , it followed its current alignment to &lt; unk &gt; , where it followed present @ - @ day Route 179 to &lt; unk &gt; to present @ - @ day County Route &lt; unk &gt; , which it followed to <unk> <unk> .
The route turned north on U.S. Route <unk> ( also designated Route 31 ) and followed that route to &lt; unk &gt; , where it followed U.S. Route 22 to Newark .
The current alignment of Route 29 from &lt; unk &gt; to Route 12 in Frenchtown was designated Route &lt; unk &gt; in 1927 .
The alignment of Route 29 between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; was eventually shifted to follow present @ - @ day U.S. Route 202 , which was also Route 30 ( now Route 31 ) between &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> and Route 12 between <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; .
In 1938 , Route &lt; unk &gt; was planned as an extension of Route &lt; unk &gt; from Frenchtown to Route 28 ( now Route <unk> ) in <unk> .
While this road was never built , much of the alignment north of <unk> is served by County Route &lt; unk &gt; .
In 1948 , a spur route , Route &lt; unk &gt; , was created , running along U.S. Route 202 ( Bridge Street ) in &lt; unk &gt; to the New <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Bridge .
In the 1953 New Jersey state highway <unk> , Route 29 was &lt; unk &gt; to continue north from &lt; unk &gt; to Frenchtown on Route &lt; unk &gt; , and the Route 29 designation between &lt; unk &gt; and Newark was removed in favor of U.S. Route 202 between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; and U.S. Route 22 between &lt; unk &gt; and Newark .
The section of former Route 29 between Route &lt; unk &gt; and Route &lt; unk &gt; became Route 165 .
Plans for a limited @ - @ access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a <unk> was proposed along the Delaware River between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ; this <unk> never <unk> .
Plans for a freeway were <unk> in the early 1950s to <unk> a road , the John <unk> Parkway , that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 in Ewing Township .
This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in &lt; unk &gt; to present @ - @ day Interstate 95 in Ewing Township .
Construction of this portion John <unk> Parkway took up much of &lt; unk &gt; ’ s available <unk> along the Delaware River .
The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of &lt; unk &gt; and in Ewing Township became Route 175 .
Between 1990 and 1995 , the Route 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township .
A two @ - @ lane street , &lt; unk &gt; Road , connected the two freeway sections .
Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in &lt; unk &gt; .
Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Railroad Bridge .
The road was to include two traffic <unk> at <unk> Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River .
The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of <unk> discovered many environmental <unk> that occurred with construction of the tunnel .
The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2 , 2002 .
A <unk> to <unk> over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002 .
By the <unk> , the state gave the part of Route 29 ( South Main Street ) between Route 165 and Route 179 in &lt; unk &gt; to the city , and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179 .
Prior to this , South Main Street had been turned one @ - @ way southbound .
Route 165 , which is only signed on <unk> street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with Route 29 .

They may not have reached Pagan , and even if they did , after having suffered heavy casualties , they returned to &lt; unk &gt; .
The Pagan Empire &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> ensued .
The Mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order in the next ten years .
In March &lt; unk &gt; , they accepted the <unk> submission of King &lt; unk &gt; of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
But &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> nine months later , and the Mongols were forced to <unk> , leading to their second invasion in <unk> – <unk> .

The arrival of the Mongols did not initially <unk> the existing order at the &lt; unk &gt; as the Mongols were <unk> on finishing off the Song .
For the next <unk> years , they <unk> their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was <unk> located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India .

In Pagan &apos; s case , he had ordered the &lt; unk &gt; governor of &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; control of the &lt; unk &gt; , and in January <unk> to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute .

Given his higher <unk> &lt; unk &gt; elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the <unk> at Pagan .
At the border , the ruler of the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; regions submitted to the Mongols .
When the &lt; unk &gt; envoys led by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; showed up , the Pagan court led by Chief Minister &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King &lt; unk &gt; to use <unk> .
The king was furious at the demand and kept the &lt; unk &gt; envoys waiting for weeks .
The court finally <unk> a <unk> : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king .
&lt; unk &gt; them was a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> who carried a letter <unk> friendly <unk> and the &lt; unk &gt; king &apos; s wish to one day <unk> a <unk> <unk> at Beijing .

&lt; unk &gt; well , O king , <unk> words . &quot;
This time , the &lt; unk &gt; king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit .

But both &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; evidence and Yuan records <unk> that the envoys were not <unk> . )
At any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to &lt; unk &gt; in due time .

In May <unk> , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned ; that the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> had no <unk> of <unk> ; and that war was the only way forward .
But the emperor rejected an <unk> invasion .
Just coming off a <unk> Japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low <unk> affair .
He was now focused on <unk> the final <unk> against the Song ; the emperor ordered the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> army to secure the &lt; unk &gt; in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees .

Even then , the 40 @ , @ 000 to 60 @ , @ 000 figures of the &lt; unk &gt; army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high ; the Mongols may have &lt; unk &gt; &quot; on the side of <unk> &quot; not to &quot; &lt; unk &gt; their <unk> in defeating superior numbers . &quot;
According to Marco Polo &apos; s account , in the early stages of the battle , the Turkish and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; took such &lt; unk &gt; at the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; that they would not be got to face the &lt; unk &gt; , but always &lt; unk &gt; and turned back , &quot; while the &lt; unk &gt; forces <unk> on .

It took place from 12 – 14 September 1942 , on &lt; unk &gt; in the Solomon Islands , and was the second of three separate major Japanese ground offensives during the &lt; unk &gt; Campaign .
In the battle , U.S. Marines , under the overall command of U.S. Major General Alexander &lt; unk &gt; , repulsed an attack by the Japanese <unk> Infantry Brigade , under the command of Japanese Major General &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The Marines were defending the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter that <unk> Henderson Field on &lt; unk &gt; , which was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on &lt; unk &gt; on 7 August 1942 .

&lt; unk &gt; .
Although the Marine defenses were almost <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s attack was ultimately defeated , with heavy losses for the Japanese .
Because of the key <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s unit in defending the ridge , the ridge was commonly referred to as &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &quot; ridge in historical accounts of the battle in Western sources .

The landings on the islands were meant to <unk> their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia .
They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to <unk> the major Japanese base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign .
The landings <unk> the six @ - @ month @ - @ long &lt; unk &gt; campaign .
<unk> the Japanese by surprise , by <unk> on 8 August the Allied landing forces had secured &lt; unk &gt; and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction at &lt; unk &gt; Point ( 9 ° 25 ′ 45 ″ S 160 ° 3 ′ 4 ″ E ) on the north <unk> of the island of &lt; unk &gt; east of the present day capital of &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; placed his 11 @ , @ 000 troops of the 1st Marine Division on &lt; unk &gt; in a loose perimeter around the &lt; unk &gt; Point area .
On 12 August , the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major &lt; unk &gt; Henderson , a Marine &lt; unk &gt; who had been killed at the Battle of <unk> .
The Allied aircraft and <unk> that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; Air Force &quot; after the Allied <unk> name for &lt; unk &gt; .
In response to the Allied landings on &lt; unk &gt; , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army &apos; s 17th Army — a corps @ - @ <unk> command based at Rabaul ( 4 ° 11 ′ 56 ″ S <unk> ° 9 ′ 57 ″ E ) and under the command of Lieutenant @ - @ General &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; — with the task of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; from Allied forces .
The 17th Army — heavily involved with the Japanese campaign in New Guinea — had only a few units available to send to the southern &lt; unk &gt; area .
Of these units , the <unk> Infantry Brigade — under Major General &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; — was at &lt; unk &gt; , the 4th ( &lt; unk &gt; ) Infantry Regiment was in the Philippines and the 28th ( &lt; unk &gt; ) Infantry Regiment — under the command of Colonel &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; — was <unk> on transport ships near <unk> .
The different units began to move toward &lt; unk &gt; immediately ; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> — the closest — arrived first .
The &quot; First &lt; unk &gt; &quot; of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s unit — consisting of about &lt; unk &gt; soldiers — landed from destroyers at &lt; unk &gt; Point ( 9 ° 24 ′ 38 ″ S 160 ° 20 ′ 56 ″ E ) , about 18 mi ( 29 km ) east of the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter , on August 19 .

The survivors returned to &lt; unk &gt; Point , <unk> 17th Army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and <unk> further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul .
By 23 August , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s unit had reached &lt; unk &gt; and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to &lt; unk &gt; .
Because of the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the Battle of the Eastern &lt; unk &gt; , the Japanese decided not to deliver &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s troops to &lt; unk &gt; by slow transport ship ; instead , the ships carrying &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s soldiers were sent to Rabaul .
From there , the Japanese planned to deliver &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s men to &lt; unk &gt; by destroyers , <unk> through a Japanese naval base in the &lt; unk &gt; Islands .
The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down &quot; The &lt; unk &gt; &quot; to &lt; unk &gt; and back in a single night , &lt; unk &gt; their <unk> to Allied air attack .
However , most of the soldiers &apos; heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to &lt; unk &gt; with them .
These high @ - @ speed destroyer runs to &lt; unk &gt; , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the &quot; Tokyo <unk> &quot; by Allied forces and &quot; <unk> Transportation &quot; by the Japanese .
The Japanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the <unk> and were not challenged by the Allies .
However , any Japanese ship remaining within the 200 mi ( <unk> km ) range of the aircraft at Henderson Field in <unk> was in great <unk> from air attacks .
This &quot; <unk> <unk> situation &quot; held for several months .

Because of a <unk> of fuel , &lt; unk &gt; could not make the entire round trip to &lt; unk &gt; at high speed in one night , but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a <unk> speed which &lt; unk &gt; fuel .

&lt; unk &gt; took &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> and the three destroyers returned to the &lt; unk &gt; without completing their mission .
The attack on &lt; unk &gt; killed 62 of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s soldiers and 94 crew members .

Between 29 August and 4 September , various Japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost 5 @ , @ 000 troops at &lt; unk &gt; Point , including all of the <unk> Infantry Brigade , one battalion of the &lt; unk &gt; Regiment , and the rest of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> .
General &lt; unk &gt; , who landed at &lt; unk &gt; Point on the 31 August <unk> run , was placed in command of all the Japanese troops on &lt; unk &gt; .
On the night of 4 / 5 September , as three of the <unk> destroyers — &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; — prepared to shell Henderson Field after landing their troops , they detected and sank two U.S. ships in the <unk> , the small , old destroyer transports ( called &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; by the U.S. Marines ) USS Little and <unk> that were used to &lt; unk &gt; Allied troops around the &lt; unk &gt; / &lt; unk &gt; area .
In <unk> of the <unk> of the destroyer runs , &lt; unk &gt; insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to &lt; unk &gt; by slow <unk> .

On 4 – 5 September , aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the <unk> convoy , killing about 90 of the soldiers in the <unk> and destroying much of the unit &apos; s heavy equipment .
Most of the remaining 1 @ , @ 000 troops were able to land near &lt; unk &gt; ( 9 ° 15 ′ 32 ″ S <unk> ° 40 ′ 18 ″ E ) , west of the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter over the next few days .
By 7 September , &lt; unk &gt; had 5 @ , @ 200 troops at &lt; unk &gt; Point and 1 @ , @ 000 west of the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter .
&lt; unk &gt; was <unk> enough that he could defeat the Allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to <unk> his forces .
&lt; unk &gt; believed that there were only about 2 @ , @ 000 U.S. Marines on &lt; unk &gt; .
During this time , &lt; unk &gt; continued to direct efforts to <unk> and improve the defenses of the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter .
Between 21 August and 3 September , he relocated three Marine battalions — including the 1st &lt; unk &gt; Battalion , under U.S.
Lieutenant Colonel <unk> A.
&lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Raiders ) , and the 1st Parachute Battalion — from &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; .

On 7 September , &lt; unk &gt; issued his attack plan to &quot; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; the enemy in the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; Island airfield . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s plan called for his forces to split into three , approach the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s force would attack the perimeter from the west while &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Second &lt; unk &gt; — renamed the &lt; unk &gt; Battalion — would attack from the east .
The main attack would be by &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &quot; Center <unk> &quot; , numbering 3 @ , @ 000 men in three battalions , from the south of the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter .
By 7 September , most of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s troops had started <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; towards &lt; unk &gt; Point along the <unk> .
About 250 Japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade &apos; s supply base at &lt; unk &gt; .
Meanwhile , native island <unk> — directed by British government official and officer in the British Solomon Islands &lt; unk &gt; Defence Force , Martin &lt; unk &gt; — told the Marines of Japanese troops at &lt; unk &gt; , near the village of &lt; unk &gt; , about 17 mi ( 27 km ) east of &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; launched a raid against the Japanese troops at &lt; unk &gt; .

&lt; unk &gt; and his first wave of &lt; unk &gt; troops landed at &lt; unk &gt; at 05 : 20 ( local time ) on 8 September .
&lt; unk &gt; by aircraft from Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s men advanced towards &lt; unk &gt; village but were slowed by Japanese resistance .
At 11 : 00 , the rest of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s men landed .
With this <unk> and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s force pushed into the village .
The Japanese defenders , believing a major landing was <unk> after <unk> the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards &lt; unk &gt; Point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind 27 dead .
Two Marines were killed .
In &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s troops discovered the supply base for &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s forces , including large &lt; unk &gt; of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a &lt; unk &gt; radio .
The Marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter at 17 : 30 .
The <unk> of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3 @ , @ 000 Japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack .
&lt; unk &gt; and Colonel <unk> Thomas , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s operations officer , believed that the Japanese attack would come at the &lt; unk &gt; Ridge , a <unk> , <unk> , 1 @ , @ 000 m ( 1 @ , @ 100 yd ) long , <unk> ridge ( 9 ° 26 ′ 39 ″ S 160 ° 2 ′ 50 ″ E ) parallel to the &lt; unk &gt; River just south of Henderson Field .
The ridge offered a natural &lt; unk &gt; of approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; and Thomas tried to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; to move forces to defend the ridge , but &lt; unk &gt; refused , believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast .
Finally , Thomas convinced &lt; unk &gt; that the ridge was a good location for &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Raiders to &quot; rest &quot; from their actions of the preceding month .
On 11 September , the <unk> men of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s unit — including the 1st Raiders and the &lt; unk &gt; — deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Center <unk> of troops was planning to attack the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter at the ridge , which they called &quot; the &lt; unk &gt; &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) because of its shape .
On 9 September , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s troops left the coast at &lt; unk &gt; Point .
&lt; unk &gt; into four <unk> , they <unk> into the jungle towards their &lt; unk &gt; attack points south and southeast of the airfield .
&lt; unk &gt; of good <unk> , at least one <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , and thick , almost <unk> jungle caused the Japanese <unk> to <unk> slowly and &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> a lot of time .
At the same time , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s troops approached the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter from the west .
&lt; unk &gt; had some intelligence on the Marine defenses , <unk> from a U.S. Army pilot captured on 30 August .
During the day of 12 September , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night &apos; s attacks .
&lt; unk &gt; wanted his three Center <unk> battalions in place by 14 : 00 , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22 : 00 .
&lt; unk &gt; was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west .
Only the &lt; unk &gt; battalion reported that they were in place on time .
Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions , &lt; unk &gt; was still <unk> in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot <unk> that the ridge was the <unk> part of the Marine defenses .
Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during <unk> on 11 – 12 September , causing a few casualties , including two killed .
= = = First night &apos; s action = = = The Americans knew of the approach of the Japanese forces from reports from native <unk> and their own patrols , but did not know <unk> where or when they would attack .
The ridge around which &lt; unk &gt; deployed his men consisted of three distinct &lt; unk &gt; .
At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill 80 ( so named because it rose 80 ft ( 24 m ) above sea level ) .
Six hundred yards north was Hill 123 ( 123 ft ( 37 m ) high ) , the dominant feature on the ridge .
The &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> and about 60 ft ( 18 m ) high .
&lt; unk &gt; placed the five companies from the &lt; unk &gt; battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hill 123 .
Two of the five &lt; unk &gt; companies , &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; , held a line between the ridge , a small , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , and the &lt; unk &gt; River .
<unk> @ - @ gun teams from &quot; E &quot; Company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses .
&lt; unk &gt; placed his command post on Hill 123 .
At 21 : 30 on 12 September , the Japanese cruiser &lt; unk &gt; and three destroyers <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; perimeter for 20 minutes and <unk> the ridge with a &lt; unk &gt; .
Japanese artillery began <unk> the Marine lines , but did little damage .
At the same time , scattered groups of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s troops began &lt; unk &gt; with Marines around the ridge .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s 1st Battalion — led by Major &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; — attacked the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &quot; C &quot; company between the &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; River , <unk> at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s unit became <unk> with troops from &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , who were still <unk> to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion <unk> stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night .

Although both &lt; unk &gt; in the west and the &lt; unk &gt; unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at <unk> .
At first light on 13 September , &lt; unk &gt; Air Force aircraft and Marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge , forcing any Japanese out in the open to <unk> cover in the nearby jungle .
The Japanese suffered several casualties , including two officers from &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s battalion .

He pulled his front back about 400 yd ( 370 m ) to a line that <unk> 1 @ , @ 800 yd ( 1 @ , @ 600 m ) , starting at the &lt; unk &gt; River and crossing the ridge about 150 yd ( 140 m ) south of Hill 123 .
Around and behind Hill 123 he placed five companies .
<unk> Japanese <unk> &lt; unk &gt; Hill 80 would have to advance over 400 yd ( 370 m ) of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill 123 .
With only a few hours to prepare , the Marines were only able to <unk> <unk> and shallow fortifications .
They were low on ammunition , with one or two <unk> for each Marine .
&lt; unk &gt; ordered a reserve force consisting of the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment ( 2 / 5 ) to move into a position just to the rear of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s troops .
In addition , a battery of four &lt; unk &gt; <unk> from the 11th Marine Regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery <unk> was placed with &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s front line units .
Late in the afternoon , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> onto a <unk> box and <unk> his <unk> troops , saying , You men have done a great job , and I have just one more thing to <unk> of you .
&lt; unk &gt; out just one more night .
I know we &apos; ve been without <unk> a long time .
But we <unk> another attack from them <unk> and they may come through here .
I have every reason to believe that we will have <unk> here for all of us in the morning .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s speech &quot; raised the <unk> &quot; of the Raiders and helped them prepare <unk> for the night ahead .
As the sun set on 13 September , &lt; unk &gt; faced &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s 830 Marines with 3 @ , @ 000 troops of his brigade , <unk> an <unk> of light artillery .
The night was pitch black , with no <unk> .
At 21 : 00 , seven Japanese destroyers briefly <unk> the ridge .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s attack began just after <unk> , with &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s battalion assaulting &lt; unk &gt; Company B on the Marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge .
The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123 .
Under Marine artillery fire , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> his men and continued his attack .
Without &lt; unk &gt; to try to &quot; roll @ - @ up &quot; the other nearby Marine units , whose <unk> were now <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s unit &lt; unk &gt; forward through the <unk> lowlands between the ridge and the &lt; unk &gt; River , heading for the airfield .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s men came upon a <unk> of Marine supplies and <unk> .
Not having <unk> <unk> for a couple of days , they <unk> to &quot; &lt; unk &gt; themselves &quot; on the &quot; C &quot; and &quot; K &quot; <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; ordered his men to continue the attack .
At about <unk> : 00 , he led them against the Marine units around the northern portion of the ridge , just short of the airfield , as well as Hill 123 .
In the heavy fighting that followed , &lt; unk &gt; and around 100 of his men were killed , ending that attack .
Meanwhile , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s 2nd Battalion , under Major &lt; unk &gt; Tamura , assembled for their planned assault against Hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge .
Marine observers <unk> Tamura &apos; s <unk> and called in artillery fire .
At about 22 : 00 , a barrage from twelve 105 mm ( 4 @ .

In response , two companies of Tamura &apos; s troops — numbering about <unk> men — charged up Hill 80 with fixed <unk> behind their own barrage of mortar fire and <unk> .
Tamura &apos; s attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also &lt; unk &gt; Company B , pushing the &lt; unk &gt; off the east side of the ridge into a <unk> below the &lt; unk &gt; .
To protect the exposed &lt; unk &gt; Company B , &lt; unk &gt; immediately ordered them to <unk> back onto Hill 123 .
At the same time , a Japanese company from &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s battalion <unk> through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C. &lt; unk &gt; that their positions were now &lt; unk &gt; , Parachute <unk> B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123 .
In the <unk> and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became <unk> and <unk> .
A few Marines began &lt; unk &gt; that the Japanese were attacking with <unk> gas , &lt; unk &gt; other Marines who no longer <unk> their gas masks .
After arriving behind Hill 123 , some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word &quot; withdraw &quot; to anyone within &lt; unk &gt; .

Marine 105 mm and 75 mm artillery was also taking a heavy <unk> on the attacking Japanese .
A captured Japanese soldier later said that his unit was &quot; <unk> &quot; by the Marine artillery fire , which only 10 % of his company survived .

A <unk> by the Marine engineers stopped one Japanese company &apos; s <unk> and forced it to retreat .
The other two companies <unk> at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield .
When no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after &lt; unk &gt; .
Most of the rest of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night .
As the sun rose on 14 September , <unk> of Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge .
But with Tamura &apos; s battalion <unk> after losing &lt; unk &gt; of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s assault on the ridge had <unk> ended .
About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south <unk> of Hill 80 , perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123 .
At first light , three U.S. Army aircraft from the <unk> <unk> Squadron at Henderson Field , acting on a request <unk> delivered by <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them , with the few survivors <unk> back into the jungle .

Three passengers survived by <unk> in the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived .
&lt; unk &gt; leader Joshua &lt; unk &gt; publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the &lt; unk &gt; in an interview with the BBC &apos; s Today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground .
The majority of &lt; unk &gt; , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of <unk> .
A <unk> white Rhodesian <unk> followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> of blacks in general , even though few black &lt; unk &gt; supported attacks of this kind .

They <unk> in English , both to the survivors and among themselves .
They told the passengers to &lt; unk &gt; around a point a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able @ - @ <unk> men to carry the others .
The passengers were assembled into an area of about 10 square metres ( 110 sq ft ) .
Standing roughly 15 metres ( 49 ft ) away , the <unk> now raised their weapons . &quot;

&lt; unk &gt; it was personal ammunition in the <unk> <unk> in the heat , they continued on their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still <unk> .
This <unk> the insurgents to the presence of more survivors ; one of the guerrillas told &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s group to &quot; come here &quot; .
The insurgents then opened fire on their general location , prompting &lt; unk &gt; and the others to flee .
Hill and the &lt; unk &gt; also ran ; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their &lt; unk &gt; , but successfully <unk> themselves behind a ridge .
After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours , they saw the <unk> return to the crash site at about 19 : 45 .

The prominent Indian @ - @ Rhodesian &lt; unk &gt; family was particularly <unk> by the incident , having lost eight members in the attack .
Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately <unk> the cause of the crash , doing so only after four days &apos; investigation , the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours .
Smith wrote in his memoirs that the &quot; <unk> of <unk> ... &#91; was &#93; difficult to control &quot; .
White South <unk> were similarly <unk> , particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the &lt; unk &gt; had <unk> the female passengers before &lt; unk &gt; them .

He instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , <unk> them that many rural blacks only <unk> the guerrillas under <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , and that it would not do to attack them .

The population of &lt; unk &gt; began a <unk> <unk> of growth starting in the &lt; unk &gt; Period ( approximately 2000 BC – AD 200 ) , with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830 , followed by a sharp decline .
For the 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the &lt; unk &gt; defenses of the <unk> , the peak population is estimated at &lt; unk &gt; per square <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; per square mile ) .
In an area within a 12 kilometres ( 7 @ .

In a region within a 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at <unk> @ , @ 000 with a density of <unk> per square <unk> ( <unk> per square mile ) .
These population figures are even more <unk> because of the extensive &lt; unk &gt; that were <unk> for <unk> or <unk> .
However , some archaeologists , such as David <unk> , believe these figures to be far too high .

A &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> dating from about 700 @ - @ 400 BC were found in a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , a <unk> <unk> @ - @ shaped chamber .
Major construction at &lt; unk &gt; was already taking place in the Late &lt; unk &gt; period , first appearing around 400 – 300 BC , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still &lt; unk &gt; by sites further north such as El &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
At this time , &lt; unk &gt; participated in the widespread &lt; unk &gt; culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire &lt; unk &gt; Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of <unk> .
Two temples dating to Late &lt; unk &gt; times had <unk> @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; that may have been &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ vaulted , although this has not been <unk> .
One of these had elaborate <unk> on the outer walls showing human figures against a &lt; unk &gt; background , painted in yellow , black , <unk> and red .
In the 1st century AD rich <unk> first appeared and &lt; unk &gt; underwent a political and cultural &lt; unk &gt; as its giant northern <unk> declined .
At the end of the Late &lt; unk &gt; , the &lt; unk &gt; style art and architecture from the Pacific <unk> began to influence &lt; unk &gt; , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the &lt; unk &gt; and early <unk> at the city .

According to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; , perhaps in the 3rd century AD .
At the beginning of the Early Classic , power in the Maya region was concentrated at &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , in the core of the Maya &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; may have <unk> from the collapse of the large &lt; unk &gt; states such as El &lt; unk &gt; .
In the Early Classic &lt; unk &gt; rapidly developed into the most <unk> city in the Maya region , &lt; unk &gt; the development of other nearby Maya cities .
The site , however , was often at war and inscriptions tell of &lt; unk &gt; and conflict with other Maya states , including &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
The site was defeated at the end of the Early Classic by &lt; unk &gt; , which rose to take &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s place as the <unk> center in the southern Maya lowlands .
The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between &lt; unk &gt; and its <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , with &lt; unk &gt; recording the capture of prisoners from &lt; unk &gt; .
There appears to have been a <unk> in the male <unk> by AD <unk> , when Lady &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; conducted a &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ ending <unk> , apparently as queen of the city .
= = = = &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; = = = = The <unk> king of &lt; unk &gt; was &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Ich &apos; aak ( Great <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ) .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Ich &apos; aak built a palace that was <unk> and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis .
Little is known about &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Ich &apos; aak except that he was killed on 14 January &lt; unk &gt; AD .
On the same day , &lt; unk &gt; K ’ &lt; unk &gt; ’ ( Fire Is Born ) arrived from the west , having passed through El <unk> , a site to the west of &lt; unk &gt; , on 8 January .
On Stela 31 he is named as &quot; Lord of the West &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; K ’ &lt; unk &gt; ’ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non @ - @ Maya &lt; unk &gt; of a &lt; unk &gt; combined with an <unk> , a glyph that is well known from the great <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; in the distant Valley of Mexico .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> may even have been the ruler of &lt; unk &gt; .
These recorded events strongly <unk> that &lt; unk &gt; K ’ &lt; unk &gt; ’ led a &lt; unk &gt; invasion that defeated the native &lt; unk &gt; king , who was captured and immediately <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; K &lt; unk &gt; &apos; appears to have been <unk> by a powerful political <unk> at &lt; unk &gt; itself ; roughly at the time of the conquest , a group of &lt; unk &gt; natives were apparently <unk> near the Lost World complex .
He also <unk> control over other cities in the area , including &lt; unk &gt; , where he became king , but did not take the throne of &lt; unk &gt; for himself .
Within a year , the son of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> by the name of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; I ( First <unk> ) had been installed as the tenth king of &lt; unk &gt; while he was still a <unk> , being <unk> on 13 September &lt; unk &gt; .
He <unk> for 47 years as king of &lt; unk &gt; , and remained a vassal of &lt; unk &gt; K &lt; unk &gt; &apos; for as long as the latter lived .
It seems likely that &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; I took a wife from the &lt; unk &gt; , defeated , &lt; unk &gt; dynasty and thus &lt; unk &gt; the right to rule of his son , &lt; unk &gt; Chan K &apos; awiil II .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , a small site 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) northeast of &lt; unk &gt; , was conquered by the latter during the reign of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; I.
The site became an <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> it from hostile cities further north , and also became a trade <unk> to the <unk> .
Although the new rulers of &lt; unk &gt; were foreign , their <unk> were rapidly &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; became the key ally and trading partner of &lt; unk &gt; in the Maya lowlands .
After being conquered by &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; rapidly dominated the northern and eastern &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; , together with smaller <unk> in the region , were <unk> into &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s kingdom .
Other sites , such as &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; de San <unk> near Lake &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; became <unk> of their more powerful <unk> to the north .
By the middle of the 5th century &lt; unk &gt; had a core territory of at least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in every direction .
Around the 5th century an <unk> system of fortifications consisting of <unk> and earthworks was built along the northern <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of &lt; unk &gt; lying to the east and west of the city .
<unk> fortifications were probably also built to the south .
These defenses protected &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s core population and agricultural resources , &lt; unk &gt; an area of approximately 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) .
<unk> research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose .
= = = = &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; = = = = In the 5th century the power of the city reached as far south as &lt; unk &gt; , whose founder K &apos; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; K &lt; unk &gt; &apos; <unk> &apos; was clearly connected with &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; itself was not in an <unk> Maya region and the founding of the &lt; unk &gt; dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of &lt; unk &gt; .
K &apos; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; K &lt; unk &gt; &apos; <unk> &apos; arrived in &lt; unk &gt; in December 426 and <unk> analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at &lt; unk &gt; .
An individual known as &lt; unk &gt; K &lt; unk &gt; &apos; <unk> &apos; ( <unk> K &lt; unk &gt; &apos; <unk> &apos; ) is referred to in an early text at &lt; unk &gt; and may well be the same person .
His tomb had &lt; unk &gt; characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; texts refer to him as &quot; Lord of the West &quot; , much like &lt; unk &gt; K ’ &lt; unk &gt; ’ .
At the same time , in late 426 , &lt; unk &gt; founded the nearby site of &lt; unk &gt; , possibly sponsored by &lt; unk &gt; itself .
The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region .
The interaction between these sites and &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> over the next three centuries .
A long @ - @ running rivalry between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; began in the 6th century , with each of the two cities forming its own network of <unk> hostile &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; against each other in what has been <unk> to a long @ - @ running war between two Maya &lt; unk &gt; .
The <unk> of these two <unk> adopted the title &lt; unk &gt; &apos; , a term that has not been <unk> <unk> but that <unk> something <unk> to &quot; high king &quot; .
The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the &quot; Lady of &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , who was very likely a daughter of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Ich &apos; aak II .
She seems never to have ruled in her own right , rather being <unk> with male co @ - @ rulers .
The first of these was &lt; unk &gt; &apos; B &lt; unk &gt; , who seems to have had a long career as a general at &lt; unk &gt; before becoming co @ - @ ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence .
The Lady of &lt; unk &gt; herself seems not have been <unk> in the dynastic numbering .
It appears she was later paired with <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; , who is <unk> to be the <unk> unknown 20th ruler .

= = = Late Classic = = = = = = = &lt; unk &gt; hiatus = = = = In the mid 6th century , &lt; unk &gt; seems to have allied with &lt; unk &gt; and defeated &lt; unk &gt; , closing the Early Classic .
The &quot; &lt; unk &gt; hiatus &quot; refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a <unk> in the writing of inscriptions and large @ - @ scale construction at &lt; unk &gt; .
In the latter half of the 6th century AD , a serious crisis &lt; unk &gt; the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread <unk> <unk> of public sculpture .
This hiatus in activity at &lt; unk &gt; was long <unk> until later &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; identified that the period was prompted by &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s <unk> defeat at the hands of &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in AD <unk> , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and <unk> of the king of &lt; unk &gt; .
The badly <unk> Altar 21 at &lt; unk &gt; described how &lt; unk &gt; suffered this <unk> defeat in a major war in April <unk> .
It seems that &lt; unk &gt; was an ally of &lt; unk &gt; in the wider conflict between that city and &lt; unk &gt; , with the defeat of &lt; unk &gt; having a <unk> impact upon the city .
&lt; unk &gt; was not <unk> but its power and influence were broken .
After its great victory , &lt; unk &gt; grew rapidly and some of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s population may have been <unk> relocated there .
During the hiatus period , at least one ruler of &lt; unk &gt; took <unk> with &lt; unk &gt; &apos; &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> , another of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s victims .
&lt; unk &gt; itself &lt; unk &gt; during &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s long hiatus period .
The beginning of the &lt; unk &gt; hiatus has served as a <unk> by which archaeologists commonly &lt; unk &gt; the Classic period of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> into the Early and Late Classic .
= = = = &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; = = = = In &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; founded &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , some 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) to the southwest , as a military <unk> in order to control trade along the course of the &lt; unk &gt; River .
B &lt; unk &gt; Chan K &apos; awiil was installed on the throne of the new <unk> at the age of four , in 635 , and for many years served as a <unk> vassal fighting for his brother , the king of &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> twenty years later &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was attacked by &lt; unk &gt; and was <unk> defeated .
B &lt; unk &gt; Chan K &apos; awiil was captured by the king of &lt; unk &gt; but , instead of being <unk> , he was re @ - @ <unk> on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy , and attacked &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; , forcing &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , the then king of &lt; unk &gt; , to temporarily abandon the city .
The first two rulers of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; continued to use the &lt; unk &gt; emblem glyph of &lt; unk &gt; , and they probably felt that they had a <unk> claim to the throne of &lt; unk &gt; itself .
For some reason , B &lt; unk &gt; Chan K &apos; awiil was not installed as the new ruler of &lt; unk &gt; ; instead he stayed at &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; against &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; , driving B &lt; unk &gt; Chan K &apos; awiil into an <unk> that lasted five years .
&lt; unk &gt; tried to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; within an area dominated by its allies , such as El <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
In <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; Chan K &apos; awiil I erected the first dated monument at &lt; unk &gt; in 120 years and claimed the title of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; , so ending the hiatus .
He <unk> a programme of new construction and turned the <unk> on &lt; unk &gt; when , in &lt; unk &gt; , he captured the enemy <unk> and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered .
After this , &lt; unk &gt; never again erected a monument <unk> a military victory .
= = = = &lt; unk &gt; after &lt; unk &gt; = = = = By the 7th century , there was no active &lt; unk &gt; presence at any Maya site and the center of &lt; unk &gt; had been <unk> by 700 .
Even after this , <unk> war <unk> <unk> on monuments was &lt; unk &gt; style .
&lt; unk &gt; Chan K &apos; awiil I and his <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; in Chan K &apos; awiil continued hostilities against &lt; unk &gt; and its allies and <unk> firm regional control over the area around &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> as far as the territory around Lake &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
These two rulers were responsible for much of the <unk> architecture visible today .
In <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , a vassal of &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s key ally in the south , <unk> <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; , defeated &lt; unk &gt; and gained its own independence .
It appears that this was a <unk> effort on the part of &lt; unk &gt; to bring about the collapse of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s southern allies .
This <unk> the <unk> of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; .
In the 8th century , the rulers of &lt; unk &gt; collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis .
By the late 8th century and early 9th century , activity at &lt; unk &gt; slowed .
&lt; unk &gt; architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers .
= = = <unk> Classic = = = By the 9th century , the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was <unk> across the region , with populations &lt; unk &gt; and city after city falling into silence .
<unk> <unk> warfare in the Maya region caused &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s supporting population to heavily <unk> close to the city itself , <unk> the use of <unk> <unk> and <unk> environmental decline .
Construction continued at the beginning of the century , with the <unk> of Temple 3 , the last of the city &apos; s major pyramids and the <unk> of monuments to mark the 19th K &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; .
The beginning of the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in 830 passed &lt; unk &gt; , and marks the beginning of a 60 @ - @ year hiatus , probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city .
During this hiatus , satellite sites <unk> under &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s control began to <unk> their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the &lt; unk &gt; emblem glyph , with &lt; unk &gt; apparently <unk> the authority or the power to <unk> these <unk> for independence .
In &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; K &apos; awiil is mentioned on a stela at &lt; unk &gt; as visiting that city as the <unk> Lord of &lt; unk &gt; but he is not recorded elsewhere and &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s once great power was little more than a memory .
The sites of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; had by now <unk> the once <unk> &lt; unk &gt; emblem glyph .
As &lt; unk &gt; and its <unk> reached peak population , the area suffered &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> and <unk> loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels .
&lt; unk &gt; and its immediate <unk> <unk> to have lost the majority of its population during the period from 830 to 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly .
There is not much evidence from &lt; unk &gt; that the city was directly <unk> by the <unk> warfare that <unk> parts of the Maya region during the <unk> Classic , although an <unk> of refugees from the &lt; unk &gt; region may have <unk> problems resulting from the already <unk> environmental resources .
In the latter half of the 9th century there was an attempt to <unk> royal power at the much <unk> city of &lt; unk &gt; , as <unk> by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by &lt; unk &gt; Chan K &apos; awiil II in &lt; unk &gt; .
This was the last monument erected at &lt; unk &gt; before the city finally fell into silence .
The former <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; , such as &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , did not last much longer , &lt; unk &gt; their final monuments in &lt; unk &gt; .
By the end of the 9th century the <unk> majority of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s population had <unk> the city , its royal palaces were occupied by <unk> and simple &lt; unk &gt; <unk> were being erected in the city &apos; s <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
The <unk> blocked some &lt; unk &gt; in the rooms they &lt; unk &gt; in the <unk> structures of the site and left <unk> that included a <unk> of domestic <unk> and non @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> such as musical <unk> .
These inhabitants <unk> the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them .
Some monuments were &lt; unk &gt; and some were moved to new locations .
Before its final <unk> all <unk> for the old rulers had <unk> , with the <unk> of the North Acropolis being <unk> for &lt; unk &gt; and the easier to find <unk> being <unk> .
After 950 , &lt; unk &gt; was all but <unk> , although a remnant population may have survived in &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> among the ruins .
Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the <unk> or 11th centuries and the &lt; unk &gt; claimed the ruins for the next thousand years .
Some of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s population may have <unk> to the &lt; unk &gt; Lakes region , which remained heavily <unk> in <unk> of a &lt; unk &gt; in population levels in the first half of the 9th century .
The most likely cause of collapse at &lt; unk &gt; is &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> failure .
The fall of &lt; unk &gt; was a <unk> to the heart of Classic Maya <unk> , the city having been at the <unk> of <unk> life , art and architecture for over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling dynasty .
However , new research regarding &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; from the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> system suggests that a <unk> drought may have led to the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; .
= = = Modern history = = = In &lt; unk &gt; , the Spanish &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of &lt; unk &gt; but did not mention them in his <unk> .
After Spanish <unk> &lt; unk &gt; de &lt; unk &gt; became lost in the &lt; unk &gt; forests in early &lt; unk &gt; he described a <unk> that may well have been &lt; unk &gt; .
As is often the case with huge ancient ruins , knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region .
It seems that local people never &lt; unk &gt; about &lt; unk &gt; and they <unk> &lt; unk &gt; expeditions to the ruins in the <unk> .
Some <unk> or third @ - @ hand accounts of &lt; unk &gt; appeared in <unk> starting in the 17th century , continuing through the writings of John <unk> Stephens in the early 19th century ( Stephens and his <unk> Frederick &lt; unk &gt; heard <unk> of a lost city , with white building tops <unk> above the jungle , during their <unk> @ - @ 40 travels in the region ) .
Because of the site &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; from modern <unk> , however , no <unk> visited &lt; unk &gt; until &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , respectively the <unk> and the governor of &lt; unk &gt; , visited it in <unk> .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853 .
Several other expeditions came to further investigate , map , and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in the 19th century ( including <unk> P. &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> @ - @ 82 ) and the early 20th century .
&lt; unk &gt; archaeologists started to clear , map and record the ruins in the 1880s .
In 1951 , a small <unk> was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days &apos; travel through the jungle on foot or mule .
In 1956 the &lt; unk &gt; project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area .
From 1956 through 1970 , major archaeological <unk> were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania &lt; unk &gt; Project .
They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures .

It was one of the largest of the Classic period Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the <unk> .
The architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over 70 metres ( <unk> ft ) high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of smaller pyramids , palaces , <unk> , administrative buildings , platforms and <unk> stone monuments .
There is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars across the windows and <unk> .
There are also seven courts for playing the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , including a set of 3 in the Seven Temples Plaza , a unique feature in &lt; unk &gt; .
The limestone used for construction was local and &lt; unk &gt; on @ - @ site .

The residential area of &lt; unk &gt; covers an estimated 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) , much of which has not yet been <unk> , mapped , or excavated .

It is a complex group with construction beginning in the &lt; unk &gt; Period , around 350 BC .
It developed into a <unk> complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures .
After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern <unk> , which measured 100 by 80 metres ( <unk> by <unk> ft ) , gradually <unk> it from view .
Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD , each of them had an elaborate &lt; unk &gt; and a stairway <unk> by masks of the <unk> .
By the 9th century AD , 43 stelae and 30 <unk> had been erected in the North Acropolis ; 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits .
The North Acropolis continued to receive <unk> into the &lt; unk &gt; Period .

The complex was organized as a large E @ - @ Group consisting of a pyramid <unk> with a platform to the east that supported three temples .
The Mundo &lt; unk &gt; complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history .
By AD 250 – 300 its architectural style was influenced by the great <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; in the Valley of Mexico , including the use of the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; form .
During the Early Classic period ( c .

From AD 250 to &lt; unk &gt; it may have served as the royal <unk> .
The Mundo &lt; unk &gt; complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the University of Pennsylvania ; it is <unk> upon the Lost World <unk> and a small platform to the west of it .
Group <unk> lies just south of the &lt; unk &gt; Causeway .
The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace @ - @ type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at &lt; unk &gt; .

Some of these pyramids are over 60 metres ( 200 feet ) high .
They were numbered &lt; unk &gt; during the early survey of the site .
It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years .
Temple I ( also known as the Temple of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; or Temple of the Great <unk> ) is a <unk> pyramid dedicated to &lt; unk &gt; Chan K &lt; unk &gt; , who was &lt; unk &gt; in the structure in AD &lt; unk &gt; , the pyramid was completed around <unk> – 750 .
The temple <unk> 47 metres ( <unk> ft ) high .
The massive &lt; unk &gt; that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the <unk> king , although little of this <unk> survives .
The tomb of the king was discovered by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of the University of Pennsylvania in 1962 .
Among <unk> recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of <unk> human and animal <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> scenes <unk> <unk> and people , <unk> carved and <unk> with &lt; unk &gt; , as well as &lt; unk &gt; and shell <unk> and <unk> vessels filled with <unk> of food and <unk> .

The <unk> &lt; unk &gt; is plain but the two inner &lt; unk &gt; were carved , some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown , while others were taken to <unk> in Europe .
Temple II ( also known as the Temple of the <unk> ) it was built around AD 700 and stands 38 metres ( 125 ft ) high .
Like other major temples at &lt; unk &gt; , the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> by wooden &lt; unk &gt; , only the middle of which was carved .
The temple was dedicated to the wife of &lt; unk &gt; Chan K &lt; unk &gt; , although no tomb was found .

Temple V stands south of the Central Acropolis and is the <unk> pyramid of an as yet <unk> ruler .
The temple stands 57 metres ( <unk> ft ) high , making it the second tallest structure at &lt; unk &gt; - only Temple IV is <unk> .
The temple has been dated to about AD 700 , in the Late Classic period , via &lt; unk &gt; analysis and the dating of <unk> associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in the second half of the 7th century .

&lt; unk &gt; developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31 .
The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located <unk> mi ( <unk> km ) to the south @ - @ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2 .
The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm &lt; unk &gt; around <unk> the same day .
Over the next several days , &lt; unk &gt; moved in a general west @ - @ northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3 .
<unk> wind shear , some due to the <unk> of Hurricane <unk> , and dry air caused the storm to <unk> .
On September 6 , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and <unk> waters caused &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> into a tropical depression .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to <unk> around the storm .
The low ultimately dissipated while located <unk> mi ( <unk> km ) east of &lt; unk &gt; on September 10 .

It <unk> south of Cape Verde and slowly developed , and on September 2 the <unk> became Tropical Depression Ten while located south @ - @ southeast of the Cape Verde islands .
As the depression became more organized , an eye @ - @ like feature developed in the upper levels of the system .
The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm &lt; unk &gt; six hours after forming .
&lt; unk &gt; was located in an area which was <unk> for rapid <unk> but was not forecast to <unk> quickly .
&lt; unk &gt; continued to <unk> throughout the afternoon as the storm became more <unk> .
However , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of <unk> wind speed <unk> , and the National Hurricane Center was <unk> of its actual intensity .
Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further <unk> .
The storm was also heading into an area where shear was &lt; unk &gt; to significantly increase due to an upper @ - @ level <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Despite convection being partially removed from the center of &lt; unk &gt; , the storm <unk> slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as <unk> activity to the south of the center became more organized .
The <unk> was forecast to be short in <unk> as the <unk> to the north was <unk> , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger .
&lt; unk &gt; reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) as it continued to become more organized .
However , there were <unk> that it had already begun to <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; towards the north was becoming <unk> and arc <unk> began <unk> from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system .
During the afternoon hours , the structure of &lt; unk &gt; began to rapidly <unk> as strong wind shear and dry air took their <unk> .
By the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection <unk> near the center .
Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep <unk> of convection formed in the northern &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; .
The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity .
The forecast showed a <unk> <unk> in wind shear as &lt; unk &gt; continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @ - @ day forecast was <unk> .
However , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and &lt; unk &gt; weakened again .
By the afternoon , the center of &lt; unk &gt; was only a &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> , <unk> of convection .
During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5 , convection associated with &lt; unk &gt; began to &lt; unk &gt; somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong &lt; unk &gt; wind shear .
By mid @ - @ morning , &lt; unk &gt; re @ - @ <unk> slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection .
However , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its <unk> on &lt; unk &gt; by late morning .
The convection around the system became &lt; unk &gt; from the center and &lt; unk &gt; weakened slightly .
The weakening <unk> continued through the afternoon as the storm was being <unk> by strong &lt; unk &gt; shear .
&lt; unk &gt; became almost fully <unk> of any convection by mid @ - @ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , <unk> holding on to tropical storm status .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be <unk> a tropical storm .
Due to the lack of convection , &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> to a Tropical Depression at &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) .
Since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been <unk> a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm &lt; unk &gt; over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression .
The next morning , &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the <unk> of the storm .
No redevelopment was expected with &lt; unk &gt; as it began to move over <unk> waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated .
However , the remnant low associated with &lt; unk &gt; began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 .
&lt; unk &gt; around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed .
On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again .
&lt; unk &gt; around the remnant low was <unk> away and the low was exposed once more .
The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of <unk> once the low became exposed .
Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> into an open wave .
However , on September 10 , the remnants of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> up on the <unk> system .
Once more , the chance of <unk> was possible as the remnants of &lt; unk &gt; headed towards the <unk> .
However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to <unk> entirely .

A matter of some <unk> arose after the Great Depression over the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; and its <unk> , Mount Massive , which <unk> in elevation by only 12 feet ( 3 @ .

This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive <unk> building large <unk> of stones on the summit to boost its height , only to have the Mount &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; them .
The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount &lt; unk &gt; has remained the highest peak in Colorado .

<unk> <unk> primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was &quot; &lt; unk &gt; to a democratic state &quot; .
Federal &lt; unk &gt; and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their <unk> to <unk> the activities of Scientology .
Government publications on the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; increased between 1996 and 1998 , and a significant number of them <unk> with the Church of Scientology .
The German courts had approved such publications in 1989 , seeing them as part of the government &apos; s responsibility to keep the public <unk> , and finding that they did not <unk> with religious freedom .
In 1996 , the German <unk> launched an &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) Commission to investigate &lt; unk &gt; and similar groups , in large part because of public concerns about Scientology .
Its final report , published in June 1998 , concluded that Scientology , alone among new religious movements , required <unk> by Germany &apos; s domestic intelligence services .
An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged &quot; <unk> &quot; of businesses by Scientologists , in line with Scientology &apos; s declared aim to <unk> society , politics and business in preparation for world <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and <unk> @ - @ size companies , such as <unk> agents , management <unk> and management @ - @ training companies .
Management @ - @ <unk> <unk> led by Scientologists often <unk> their association with Scientology ; once they have recruited members of their <unk> &apos; upper management , these <unk> may send employees to Scientology <unk> , as part of company education and training <unk> , without <unk> them as to the origin of the training methods used .
An <unk> commercial version of Scientology &apos; s Oxford &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , usually offered free as part of Scientology &lt; unk &gt; in public places , temporarily entered some major German companies ( who were <unk> of its &lt; unk &gt; ) via such a management @ - @ <unk> firm .
In the mid @ - @ <unk> , German sect <unk> expressed concerns that Scientologists were becoming active in the German after @ - @ school &lt; unk &gt; market .
These concerns arose because <unk> of around 20 after @ - @ school &lt; unk &gt; centres operated by Scientologists in <unk> , Hamburg , &lt; unk &gt; and elsewhere might be <unk> that their children were being <unk> by Scientologists , using Scientology methods .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology , but not Scientology itself .
In early 2008 , Thomas &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of the German <unk> Church in Berlin and &lt; unk &gt; , and the historian &lt; unk &gt; <unk> both <unk> the Scientologist Hollywood actor Tom Cruise to <unk> , the Nazi <unk> <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; and <unk> cited a <unk> Scientology video in which Cruise was seen <unk> the audience whether Scientologists should &quot; <unk> up &quot; the world , the audience <unk> with <unk> <unk> – <unk> which &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> felt were <unk> of the audience &apos; s response to <unk> &apos; famous question , &quot; <unk> you want total war ? &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s and <unk> &apos; s <unk> found few critics in Germany .
Most Germans consider Scientology a &lt; unk &gt; organization .
In 1997 , Time reported that 70 % of Germans <unk> banning Scientology ; a poll conducted in September 2008 by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; found 67 % support for a ban .
German scholars such as &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; have commented that <unk> <unk> public <unk> around Scientology in Germany : in their view , efforts to &quot; frame &quot; information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
In &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s words , this includes both the &quot; efforts of German <unk> to <unk> their popularity with strong @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; statements &quot; and &quot; Scientology &apos; s efforts to present itself as the victim of <unk> <unk> &quot; ; commenting on foreign <unk> on Scientology in Germany , she <unk> that &quot; the American press may <unk> &lt; unk &gt; news to <unk> investigation and may frame the issue according to American <unk> &quot; .
Both &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> that the situation is <unk> by the general &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> studies of Scientology .
&lt; unk &gt; as well as <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Professor of <unk> <unk> at the University of <unk> in Canada , have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany , which has made German <unk> <unk> of approaching the subject , because they fear <unk> for their research funding and for their <unk> of future employment if they <unk> themselves in the debate .
In 2010 a German public <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , showed the film Until <unk> <unk> , a &lt; unk &gt; account of the effect Scientology had on one German family .
Said to be based on a true story , the film attracted widespread media attention and a <unk> of 8 @ .
@ 69 million .
= = <unk> status = = While there have been calls for Scientology to be banned , the Church of Scientology remains legal in Germany and is allowed to operate there .
Its <unk> legal status however is <unk> .
Two points are contested : first , whether or not the <unk> of Scientology qualify as a &quot; religion or &lt; unk &gt; &quot; ( <unk> or &lt; unk &gt; ; these are equal before German law ) , and &lt; unk &gt; , whether or not these <unk> are only used as a <unk> for <unk> commercial activity ; if the latter were the case , this would most likely <unk> that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a &quot; religious or &lt; unk &gt; community &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; ) under <unk> 4 of the German constitution , which <unk> the freedom of <unk> , religion and &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> as a &quot; religious or &lt; unk &gt; community &quot; also <unk> a broad range of other issues in Germany , such as <unk> and freedom of association .
The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an <unk> decision on the matter , but <unk> assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or &lt; unk &gt; community .
The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg <unk> asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a &lt; unk &gt; community .
In 1995 , the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely <unk> commercial aims and did not <unk> a religious or &lt; unk &gt; community entitled to protection under <unk> 4 of the German Constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003 .
In another 2003 decision , the Administrative Court of Baden @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; said there were no <unk> that the <unk> of Scientology merely served as a <unk> for commercial activity .
In 2005 , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany <unk> granted a Scientologist protection under <unk> 4 @ .
@ 1 of the German Constitution , which <unk> the freedom of religion and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Many courts have declined to <unk> the religious status of Scientology , finding that the question was <unk> to <unk> the case at hand .
The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was <unk> , and that its legal status should be <unk> by its business activities .
The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or &lt; unk &gt; community and <unk> that Scientology is a profit @ - @ making <unk> , rather than a religion .
<unk> years have seen a number of court <unk> in Scientology &apos; s favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among <unk> and the general public .
= = Government surveillance = = Given the history of <unk> &apos; s rise to power in Germany in the 1930s , the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any <unk> that <unk> the values <unk> in the German constitution .
The &lt; unk &gt; domestic intelligence service ( &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) <unk> the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany &apos; s free and democratic order , and has been <unk> Scientology since 1997 , as have the &lt; unk &gt; for the Protection of the Constitution in a number of German &lt; unk &gt; .
Minister for <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> the surveillance , saying that the church had totalitarian <unk> and that she would <unk> Scientology with all the means at her <unk> .
The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the <unk> of this surveillance in court .
In December 2001 , the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the <unk> and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid &lt; unk &gt; .
The court ruled that the use of &lt; unk &gt; was &lt; unk &gt; .
In 2003 , the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were <unk> to the constitution .
At the federal level , Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the &lt; unk &gt; in November 2004 .
The federal court based its opinion on its <unk> that the aims of Scientology , as <unk> by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings , were <unk> with the German constitution .
&lt; unk &gt; acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be <unk> to Scientologists , and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking <unk> steps to <unk> society and government institutions in order to prevent anti @ - @ Scientology legislation .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> acting for the Church of Scientology had <unk> that Scientology was non @ - @ political , its aims were the <unk> of the human being , and that Hubbard &apos; s instructions were <unk> only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to <unk> , and at any rate there was no effort to <unk> these instructions in Germany .
The court <unk> and ruled that many sources , some of them not <unk> to the general public , indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the &lt; unk &gt; of the <unk> of <unk> and other essential human rights .
In &lt; unk &gt; , surveillance was stopped by a court as <unk> in 2005 , because there is no local branch of Scientology and few members .
As of 6 May 2008 , the Church of Scientology in Germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the &lt; unk &gt; after the North <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Administrative Court in &lt; unk &gt; refused to hear an appeal on the matter .
<unk> suspected of maintaining &quot; <unk> against the free , democratic basic order &quot; , the Scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and <unk> to its &lt; unk &gt; .
There is at least one example of surveillance of Scientology by the German intelligence services outside of Germany .
In 1998 , the Swiss government <unk> an agent of the German government , <unk> him with &quot; carrying out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political information service and &lt; unk &gt; identity documents &quot; .
The German government posted bail for the agent .
He was eventually given a 30 @ - @ day suspended jail sentence for &lt; unk &gt; on Scientology , and the German government <unk> to Switzerland for the incident .

Where companies are suspected of having Scientologist staff , <unk> employees are <unk> to this fact by government staff .
Government officials have <unk> the names of individual Scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses ; some &lt; unk &gt; have placed <unk> in the press saying they are not Scientologists in order to avoid the associated <unk> .
Due to concerns about possible government <unk> by Scientologists , <unk> for civil service positions in &lt; unk &gt; are required to <unk> whether or not they are Scientologists , and a similar policy has been <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; .

When it became known that <unk> &apos; s Windows 2000 operating system included a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; developed by <unk> <unk> International ( a company headed by a Scientologist ) , this caused concern among German government officials and <unk> over <unk> security and the potential for <unk> .
To &lt; unk &gt; these concerns , <unk> Germany agreed to provide a means to &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> .

On December 7 , 2007 , German federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the Scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti @ - @ <unk> goals , &lt; unk &gt; &quot; essential basic and human rights like the <unk> of man or the right to equal treatment &quot; , and asked Germany &apos; s domestic intelligence agencies to <unk> and <unk> the information required for a possible <unk> <unk> aimed at banning the organization .
The move was criticized by German <unk> from all sides of the political <unk> , with legal <unk> and intelligence agencies <unk> concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely <unk> in the courts .
<unk> Weber , president of the Church of Scientology in Berlin , called the accusations &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and said that the German interior ministers &apos; <unk> was based on &quot; a few <unk> out of 500 @ , @ 000 <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; literature &quot; .
She added , &quot; I can also find hundreds of <unk> in the <unk> that are totalitarian but that <unk> &apos; t <unk> I will demand the ban of <unk> . &quot;
In November 2008 , the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology , after finding <unk> evidence of illegal or <unk> activity .
The report by the &lt; unk &gt; cited knowledge <unk> and noted several points that would make the success of any legal <unk> to ban Scientology <unk> .
First , the &lt; unk &gt; report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization ; there were German churches and missions , a German board , German &lt; unk &gt; , and no evidence that the organization was &quot; <unk> remote @ - @ controlled &quot; from the United States .
A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one .
The second <unk> on which those <unk> the ban had <unk> was Scientology &apos; s aggressive opposition to the constitution .
Here , the report found that Scientology &apos; s behaviour gave no grounds to <unk> that Scientology <unk> sought to attack and <unk> Germany &apos; s free and democratic basic order . &quot;
<unk> its &lt; unk &gt; nor any other <unk> &quot; supported the &quot; conclusion that the organization had criminal aims &quot; .
The &lt; unk &gt; also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were &lt; unk &gt; <unk> without a <unk> , but expressed <unk> that a court would accept this <unk> .
<unk> on the decision to drop the ban attempt , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , Berlin &apos; s interior <unk> , said , &quot; This organization <unk> goals – through its writings , its concept and its <unk> for <unk> – that we cannot <unk> and that we consider in violation of the constitution .
But they put very little of this into practice .
The <unk> of the Government at the moment is that &#91; Scientology &#93; is a &lt; unk &gt; organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a <unk> to . &quot;
The Church of Scientology expressed <unk> with the decision , describing it as the &quot; only one possible &quot; .
&lt; unk &gt; of Scientology &apos; s activities by the German intelligence services continues .
In February 2009 , the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an <unk> column next to a <unk> stop in front of the Berlin Scientology headquarters , warning &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ by of the potential <unk> Scientology activities posed to <unk> and individual freedom , should be removed .
The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; which ruled that the poster <unk> Scientologists &apos; basic religious rights .
= = <unk> of Germany &apos; s stance = = The United States media , while generally <unk> negatively on Scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially <unk> stance towards Scientology in <unk> to Germany .
Richard <unk> for example , writing in the Washington Post , said in 1996 : &quot; Scientology might be one <unk> religion , but the German reaction to it is &lt; unk &gt; still – not to mention <unk> . &quot;
Alan <unk> , writing in the New York Times , wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology – motivated by officials &apos; fear that Scientology &quot; was a totalitarian movement growing , like the Nazi party , from &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; – was itself &lt; unk &gt; of &quot; the Nazi era &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
The U.S. Department of State has repeatedly claimed that Germany &apos; s actions <unk> government and <unk> discrimination against <unk> religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists &apos; individual rights posed by sect &lt; unk &gt; .
The U.S. Department of State began to include the issue of Scientology in Germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the Church of Scientology and the U.S. Internal <unk> Service , through which Scientology gained the status of a tax @ - @ <unk> religion in the United States .
That decision also marked the beginning of more <unk> <unk> efforts by the Church of Scientology in Washington , using paid &lt; unk &gt; .
The State Department &apos; s 1996 human rights report on Germany , released in January 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with Scientology <unk> &quot; may face <unk> and discrimination , sometimes with government <unk> . &quot;
Past targets of such actions had included Scientologist actors Tom Cruise and John &lt; unk &gt; , as well as jazz <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Also in January 1997 , an open letter to then @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; appeared , published as a newspaper <unk> in the International Herald <unk> , drawing <unk> between the &quot; organized <unk> &quot; of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi <unk> &lt; unk &gt; by Germany in the 1930s .

U.S. Department of State <unk> <unk> <unk> rejected the Nazi <unk> in the open letter as &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; and <unk> the U.S. government from Nazi <unk> made by the Church of Scientology , saying , &quot; We have criticized the Germans on this , but we <unk> &apos; t going to support the Scientologists &apos; <unk> tactics against the German government . &quot;
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it &quot; don &apos; t know a thing about Germany and don &apos; t want to know . &quot;
German officials argued that &quot; the whole <unk> was &lt; unk &gt; up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won &apos; t give them : tax @ - @ <unk> status as a religion .
This is &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> and simple . &quot;
<unk> explained that <unk> because of Germany &apos; s Nazi past , Germany took a determined stance against all &quot; <unk> <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; , including right @ - @ wing Nazi groups &quot; , and not just against Scientology .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Christian Democratic Union party <unk> the letter as &quot; <unk> &quot; and cited German court &lt; unk &gt; stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could <unk> be referred to using <unk> such as a &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> &quot; .

Her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom <unk> required repairs after running aground off &lt; unk &gt; following sea <unk> .
The ship departed England , after repairs in <unk> , on the day of her completion , and arrived at &lt; unk &gt; , Japan , on 23 October 1900 .
Asahi became flagship of the Standing Fleet on 22 May 1901 and was assigned to the 1st <unk> Division of the 1st Fleet when the <unk> Fleet was re @ - @ formed on 28 December <unk> .
At the start of the <unk> @ - @ Japanese War , Asahi , commanded by Captain &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet .

&lt; unk &gt; chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main <unk> and engage the ships with his secondary guns .
&lt; unk &gt; his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight @ - @ inch ( <unk> mm ) and six @ - @ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect .
Although many ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered only 17 , while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Asahi was not hit during the engagement .
The ship participated in the action of 13 April , when &lt; unk &gt; successfully <unk> out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s flagship , the battleship &lt; unk &gt; .
When &lt; unk &gt; <unk> the five battleships of the 1st Division , he turned back for Port Arthur and &lt; unk &gt; struck a <unk> laid by the Japanese the previous night .

&lt; unk &gt; by his success , &lt; unk &gt; resumed long @ - @ range bombardment missions , prompting the <unk> to lay more <unk> , which sank two Japanese battleships the following month .
During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August , Asahi , now commanded by Captain &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , was second in line of the column of Japanese battleships , behind &lt; unk &gt; , and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships .
She was only hit by a single 12 @ - @ inch shell that wounded two <unk> .
Both guns in her <unk> 12 @ - @ inch gun <unk> , however , were <unk> by shells that <unk> <unk> in their <unk> .
In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; although both ships were only <unk> damaged by the Japanese shells , which generally failed to <unk> any armour and <unk> on impact .
The ship made the critical hits of the battle , however , when two of her 12 @ - @ inch shells struck the bridge of &lt; unk &gt; , killing the Russian squadron commander , Vice Admiral &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , two of his staff officers and the ship &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; .

The second @ - @ in @ - @ command , <unk> Admiral Prince <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur .
&lt; unk &gt; more than two months later , on 26 October , Asahi struck a <unk> off Port Arthur while on <unk> <unk> .

After a <unk> tour of New Zealand in 1888 , the side travelled to England via Melbourne and Suez .

The team played its first international match on 1 December , against Ireland , and won 13 – 4 .
This was followed by a win over one of the strongest English county teams , Yorkshire , and a 5 – 0 defeat against the Wales national team .
By January 1889 the &lt; unk &gt; had played 36 matches in less than three months , winning 22 of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of England , where the playing strength was strongest and the <unk> largest and most <unk> .

He initially proposed a team of Māori or part @ - @ Māori to play the touring British side in 1888 ; this developed into a <unk> to have a Māori team tour Britain if a <unk> tour of New Zealand were successful .
&lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s plans , civil <unk> Thomas &lt; unk &gt; <unk> him to offer help <unk> the tour , which &lt; unk &gt; accepted .

&lt; unk &gt; started <unk> a team for the tour in early 1888 .
He had difficulties <unk> a squad due to player <unk> , and failed to secure the <unk> Jack &lt; unk &gt; due to his university commitments .
Some Māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the <unk> <unk> were <unk> to allow squad members who were only part @ - @ Māori .
<unk> Māori or part @ - @ Māori players joined the squad ; five &lt; unk &gt; ( white New Zealand ) players were added after the team lost to Auckland .
Due to the <unk> of these &lt; unk &gt; players the team was renamed from the &quot; New Zealand &lt; unk &gt; &quot; to the &quot; New Zealand Native Football Representatives &quot; .
The final squad comprised 26 players ( including &lt; unk &gt; ) ; of these at least five were full @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Māori , while fourteen had a Māori mother and a &lt; unk &gt; father .
The <unk> of some of the players is unknown .

Said &lt; unk &gt; <unk> we were on the platform waiting for the London train , &quot; I think they would have just <unk> us , even if we had been in good form . &quot;
Following the match against Middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest English rugby teams were based .
Yorkshire and <unk> dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the RFU in <unk> over the issue of &quot; broken time &quot; <unk> .
The New Zealanders lost to <unk> 1 – 0 , defeated &lt; unk &gt; , then lost to Wakefield .
After their first <unk> of the tour ( against <unk> County ) they defeated Stockton @ - @ on @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
Joe &lt; unk &gt; appeared in the match against &lt; unk &gt; , but <unk> the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point .
These victories were followed by a 13 – 4 defeat to <unk> on 10 November .
The team then won seven matches in a row , including one against &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , their only Scottish opposition of the tour .
The last two matches that month were a loss to &lt; unk &gt; and a 9 – 0 victory over <unk> and District .
The team had played <unk> <unk> during November and won ten of them .
By this point , the team was <unk> by injuries – of the <unk> players that played against &lt; unk &gt; County on 24 November , five had injuries .
The squad comprised only 26 players , and the tourists were often <unk> to field a side .
Nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued ; on 30 November 1888 they left for <unk> , where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team .
= = Ireland , further English matches , and Wales = = The Ireland fixture was played at <unk> Road , <unk> , on 1 December 1888 .
Both teams had a number of leading players out injured – the Irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection .
Ireland led 3 – 0 at half @ - @ time after scoring a converted try , but the &lt; unk &gt; improved <unk> in the second @ - @ half , scoring four tries .
Patrick &lt; unk &gt; scored the first two tries , and his play was praised by the local press .
The third try scored was by Thomas &lt; unk &gt; after a counter @ - @ attack by George Williams .
The try was not converted , but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a 13 – 4 victory .
The Irish press were <unk> by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to <unk> in the 1889 Home Nations Championship .
Following their defeat of Ireland , the &lt; unk &gt; played <unk> College and then North of Ireland .
The match against <unk> College was drawn 4 – 4 , and despite &lt; unk &gt; not playing , the Native side played much better than their previous fixture .
The team then travelled to <unk> , where they defeated North of Ireland 2 – 0 on 5 December ; scoring two tries to <unk> .
After returning to England , the &lt; unk &gt; faced <unk> in Manchester , where they lost 1 – 0 .
Two days later they drew with &lt; unk &gt; Bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring five tries .
Their next match was against Yorkshire , who were one of the strongest counties in the country , and went on to win the <unk> County Championship that season .
Yorkshire <unk> a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated 10 – 6 by the &lt; unk &gt; , who scored six tries .
After a further two victories , the team travelled to Wales , where they lost 3 – 0 to &lt; unk &gt; , before facing Wales on 22 December .
At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and &lt; unk &gt; feeling <unk> by the lack of selection of their players .
Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time , and out of the 15 @ - @ man team only William <unk> and William Bowen of Swansea and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; had been selected .
The match was played in Swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with <unk> <unk> of only £ 120 recorded .
The crowd &apos; s <unk> <unk> on the players , and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; was &quot; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; at the start of the match .
&lt; unk &gt; , aged 18 years and 49 days , became the <unk> Welsh international player – a record he held until the debut of Tom &lt; unk &gt; in 2010 .
Despite the &lt; unk &gt; aimed primarily at &lt; unk &gt; , Charlie Arthur and George Thomas , the Welsh team produced an <unk> effort , especially from the <unk> .
<unk> scored the first Welsh try , which was converted by Jim <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; <unk> with a <unk> run by &lt; unk &gt; , but he failed to break through the Welsh defence .
The tourists <unk> even further after George Thomas scored a &lt; unk &gt; try &lt; unk &gt; the half @ - @ way line , which went some way to silence the &lt; unk &gt; from the crowd .
<unk> , playing in out of position at full @ - @ back , missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark .
The &lt; unk &gt; continued to push , with <unk> coming within five @ - @ yards of the try line , and when &lt; unk &gt; did <unk> to cross the line he was carried back into the 25 @ - @ yard line before he could touch down .
In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; the ball into the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; 25 ; this was collected by Sydney <unk> , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing Jim &lt; unk &gt; to score .
&lt; unk &gt; for the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further <unk> in the game .
The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed .
In the <unk> Home Nations Championship Wales had &lt; unk &gt; the four three @ - @ quarter system , <unk> the team would play with eight <unk> rather than nine , and instead <unk> an extra centre three @ - @ quarter .
The system was deemed a failure and was particularly <unk> with star Welsh player Arthur Gould , whose <unk> ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward .
With Gould working in the West Indies , Wales again tried the four three @ - @ quarter system against the &lt; unk &gt; , and its success saw the team <unk> <unk> the system .
Within six years the other three Home <unk> had adopted four three @ - @ quarter style of play .
Before they left Wales , the &lt; unk &gt; played Swansea and two other local clubs , Newport , and Cardiff .
They defeated Swansea for their first win in Wales , and followed this up with a victory over Newport in front of 8 @ , @ 000 <unk> .
They finished their Welsh matches , and the year , with a 4 – 1 loss to Cardiff in front of a <unk> crowd .
= = <unk> to England = = The side entered 1889 having played 36 matches for 22 wins and three <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; &apos; play had improved throughout November and December following <unk> form in their October matches ; positive press reports <unk> this <unk> .
The team would go on to play a further 17 matches before their 16 February international against England .
January started with a 4 – 1 loss to <unk> , during which 25 police officers were required to keep many of the 12 @ , @ 000 <unk> , many of them non @ - @ <unk> , in order .
This was followed by victories over <unk> <unk> Church , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and <unk> .
Following further matches against &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced Yorkshire for a second time .
Yorkshire had been criticised in the press for <unk> a weakened line @ - @ up against the &lt; unk &gt; when the sides first met in December .
After the unexpected loss , Yorkshire were determined to make &lt; unk &gt; and a strong side was selected for the county , including Fred &lt; unk &gt; , Richard &lt; unk &gt; and John <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , all of whom would appear for England against the &lt; unk &gt; later that season .
<unk> as &quot; knocked about &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; , the &lt; unk &gt; struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to &lt; unk &gt; left the <unk> at 9 – 1 at half @ - @ time .
The second @ - @ half was little better for the &lt; unk &gt; ; they <unk> a further two tries as well as a drop @ - @ goal .
The second of these tries was scored by &lt; unk &gt; after he ran the ball from his own half .
&lt; unk &gt; scored a converted try late in the match , but this didn &apos; t prevent the &lt; unk &gt; suffering their largest defeat of the tour : 16 – 4 to the &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; later described the match as &quot; without a &lt; unk &gt; , the <unk> beating we received in our whole tour &quot; .
After a victory over &lt; unk &gt; Valley District , the team travelled west to play &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and won all five games .
The victory over <unk> was the New Zealanders &apos; largest of the tour ; they scored nine tries in a 17 – 4 victory .
<unk> @ - @ back &lt; unk &gt; played <unk> for the &lt; unk &gt; , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition .
<unk> and &lt; unk &gt; suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders , before a strong <unk> side was dismissed .
After defeating <unk> <unk> , the &lt; unk &gt; returned to London .
The team had two further matches before their international against England .
The first was against one of the strongest clubs in England , &lt; unk &gt; .
Andrew &lt; unk &gt; , who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side , played for the club in their 9 – 3 defeat to the &lt; unk &gt; .
The New Zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by &lt; unk &gt; .
Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly <unk> Royal Navy players .
The &lt; unk &gt; were again <unk> , this time 10 – 0 .
The match against Oxford University was <unk> due to heavy &lt; unk &gt; , and so the team had a seven @ - @ day break from playing – their longest of the tour .
= = England international = = The match against England was causing the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; players and management problems before it had even begun .
The team manager , Scott , was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played – the RFU were <unk> that the match should take place at &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s ground , but Scott wanted the game to <unk> at The <unk> , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher <unk> <unk> , could be secured .
The <unk> <unk> RFU establishment were already <unk> of the profit @ - @ making <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; , and were unwilling to <unk> on the selection of venue .
The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home &lt; unk &gt; over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
Following a disputed try in an England – Scotland international match in 1888 , the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to <unk> the game , but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a <unk> vote , <unk> that they <unk> this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs .
Ireland , Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until <unk> , when , following <unk> , the RFU <unk> and joined the &lt; unk &gt; .
The absence of international matches was a <unk> in England <unk> to face the &lt; unk &gt; on 16 February 1889 .
The line @ - @ <unk> selected for the 16 February match were both strong , and close to full strength .
Though 12 of the England side had not played <unk> before , all were experienced at domestic level .
The match was &lt; unk &gt; by <unk> Hill , who had also &lt; unk &gt; the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; first match in Britain , against Surrey .
The opening of the first half was a <unk> affair , with much <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; on the heavy ground .
Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry <unk> , but both were disputed by the &lt; unk &gt; , who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in @ - @ goal .
England took the two @ - @ try advantage into the second half .
Early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the English .
The try and its aftermath caused controversy and a <unk> between the &lt; unk &gt; and the RFU .
&lt; unk &gt; attempted to <unk> the English player &lt; unk &gt; , and in the process <unk> his <unk> off .
The &lt; unk &gt; quickly formed a circle around &lt; unk &gt; to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen .
While this was <unk> one of the English players , Frank &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> up the ball and scored a try .
The New Zealanders <unk> , believing that play had stopped after claiming &lt; unk &gt; had called &quot; dead ball &quot; – but Hill awarded the try , prompting three of the Native players , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Williams , and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , to leave the field in protest .
The &lt; unk &gt; players were eventually <unk> to return , but not before Hill had &lt; unk &gt; play .
&lt; unk &gt; was very critical of Hill , particularly because he was also <unk> of the RFU .
&lt; unk &gt; wrote after the tour that &quot; gross as these <unk> were , they were <unk> when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the <unk> of the game , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; at all in that game &quot; .
The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English , who ultimately won 7 – 0 .
The RFU , at Hill &apos; s <unk> , <unk> demanded an <unk> from the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; captain of the day , Edward &lt; unk &gt; , who had led the team as Joe &lt; unk &gt; was injured .
The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a <unk> was above question , and that <unk> a decision as the New Zealanders had done was <unk> .
The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players – in other words , the entire rugby playing population of England – from facing the &lt; unk &gt; if they did not &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> sent an <unk> by <unk> , but this was deemed <unk> ; he therefore sent another , four days after the game : The London establishment that <unk> the game were <unk> by the New Zealanders &apos; approach to the game ; reports of <unk> and over @ - @ aggressive play by the &lt; unk &gt; had <unk> increased in <unk> since their arrival in Britain .
In the north of England , criticism of the visitors &apos; &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south .
Some of the &lt; unk &gt; , including Joe &lt; unk &gt; , accused the RFU and the English press of <unk> , claiming that they were quick to &lt; unk &gt; the New Zealanders for <unk> play , yet <unk> of similar behaviour from their own players .
= = Later matches and departure from England = = The &lt; unk &gt; remained in London following the England international .
They defeated London Welsh on 18 February , before losing first to Cambridge , then Oxford University .
From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to <unk> .
After a win over &lt; unk &gt; , there was a defeat to <unk> , played on a ground &lt; unk &gt; said was so <unk> it was <unk> .
After <unk> their previous loss to <unk> with a 6 – 0 win , the &lt; unk &gt; suffered a loss to <unk> and District on 7 March .
The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 <unk> with <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists &apos; last match in northern England .
The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain .
They eventually played Southern <unk> , and beat them 3 – 1 .
This was their &lt; unk &gt; match in the British Isles and their <unk> victory .
The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively , and the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> ship without a <unk> <unk> .
This perceived &lt; unk &gt; from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London , as well as from the team manager Scott , who felt that with the team &apos; s official <unk> after the England match , the controversy should have put to rest .
= = Australia = = The majority of the &lt; unk &gt; left <unk> on 29 March ( &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; followed a week later ) .
They arrived in Melbourne in May , where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football , hoping to make more money that way .
Although the side had employed Jack &lt; unk &gt; to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles , the heavy schedule and high injury <unk> had left little time and <unk> for such training .
As a result , the Victorian Rules matches were a failure ; the players &apos; &lt; unk &gt; with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the &lt; unk &gt; were rugby <unk> ( and therefore less <unk> to the more open Victorian Rules ) , <unk> that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large <unk> .
The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total , including one in New South Wales , but won only three of them , all against relatively weak opposition .
The side &apos; s success in their rugby matches <unk> to their failure in Victorian Rules – the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria : against Melbourne , a Navy selection , and Victoria .
The matches were all won , with their game against Victoria a 19 – 0 victory .
After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated New South Wales 12 – 9 .
After two further victories , the side again faced New South Wales , and won the match 16 – 12 .
Another two victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour – both defeats .
The team travelled north to Queensland , where , as in New South Wales , rugby was the dominant <unk> of football .
Consequently , the team <unk> played rugby while in the region .
The &lt; unk &gt; faced Queensland at the Association <unk> in Brisbane .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> the New Zealanders <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; to win 22 – 0 ; the &lt; unk &gt; did not <unk> themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their <unk> .
After a further two matches , against &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> ( both of whom were <unk> defeated ) , the team returned to Brisbane for a <unk> with Queensland .
In contrast to their first meeting , the first @ - @ half was a close affair , and the two sides were <unk> at the conclusion of the half .
Billy &lt; unk &gt; suffered a kick to the head , and had to <unk> early in the second @ - @ half .
Following the loss of &lt; unk &gt; , the play of the &lt; unk &gt; improved and they recovered to win 11 – 7 .
Not long after the game concluded <unk> <unk> that some of the players had been offered <unk> 50 by &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> the game .
&lt; unk &gt; later said : It was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought , in racing &lt; unk &gt; , to be playing &quot; <unk> &quot; , and that they had been got by some &lt; unk &gt; ; at all events , when accused of it at half @ - @ time and <unk> , they played a different game in the second half .
The response from the team &apos; s management was to <unk> four players .
The team travelled to &lt; unk &gt; , where they defeated the <unk> 19 – 0 .
The &lt; unk &gt; included a replacement player for only the second time , Charles &lt; unk &gt; , after the &lt; unk &gt; reduced the playing strength of the side .
The team then travelled back to New Zealand , and arrived in &lt; unk &gt; on 5 August .
= = <unk> to New Zealand = = Two days after their return , the &lt; unk &gt; faced &lt; unk &gt; , who they defeated 5 – 1 in front of a crowd of 2 @ , @ 000 .
The side suffered further injury , to Harry Lee , and recruited &lt; unk &gt; W. &lt; unk &gt; for their match against &lt; unk &gt; District on 8 August .
Despite playing the match two players down , the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> defeated &lt; unk &gt; 16 – 3 .
Following the side &apos; s return to New Zealand , the &lt; unk &gt; Rugby Football Union demanded that the team &apos; s management <unk> the accusations <unk> at them in Queensland .
&lt; unk &gt; responded by <unk> that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was <unk> no <unk> had occurred .
The Northern Rugby Union ( since renamed Queensland Rugby Union ) <unk> the incident and aftermath in the 1889 Queensland Rugby Union <unk> : ... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was <unk> with the &lt; unk &gt; , as they were not showing their usual <unk> and combination .
Four members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match .
The matter was bought before the &lt; unk &gt; Union , who passed the following <unk> : That , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the Native Team , and having received an <unk> <unk> of charges from the accused members and a <unk> <unk> from the management , we are of opinion that there are no <unk> before us &lt; unk &gt; the allegations ...
It is unlikely , given the attitude of the &lt; unk &gt; Rugby Union to the &lt; unk &gt; before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if &lt; unk &gt; evidence had <unk> .
The side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced &lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; their opponents five tries to two , and won 11 – 8 .
The side &apos; s star player and half @ - @ back , &lt; unk &gt; , stayed in &lt; unk &gt; when the team departed for &lt; unk &gt; .
The side faced &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Bay , who were touring , in &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; defeated them 13 – 2 .
The &lt; unk &gt; &apos; play was praised by The Press : &quot; ... the &lt; unk &gt; of the black passed with remarkable <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; between their legs , over their <unk> , under their arms and with their feet &quot; .
The side then faced Canterbury on 17 August , who they &lt; unk &gt; 15 – 0 .
The report published in The Press said of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; performance : The play showed on <unk> afternoon was a fine <unk> of what several months of combination and practice will do ... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men .
In the loose , in the &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , passing , &lt; unk &gt; , or running they were very much <unk> Canterbury &apos; s superior .
Such runs as were made by &lt; unk &gt; at full back , by <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , and W. &lt; unk &gt; , the passing of H. &lt; unk &gt; , F. &lt; unk &gt; , and all the backs as well as several <unk> , the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; , and the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; powers of nearly every one , &lt; unk &gt; their opponents ...
The side left &lt; unk &gt; and travelled north where they played &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> .
The match was won 10 – 8 , and the next day they faced Wellington , who they also defeated .
The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby Union could not <unk> on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; all profit from the match .
After this the &lt; unk &gt; travelled to Auckland where they played their last match , against the province on 24 August .
The match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> a drop @ - @ goal and a conversion .
The loss ended a remarkable run of matches – the &lt; unk &gt; had a 31 @ - @ game <unk> <unk> in rugby matches that started with their victory over &lt; unk &gt; on 9 March ; the side won 30 , and drew one match between the defeats .
= = Impact and <unk> = = The tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within New Zealand .
It was the first tour of the British Isles by a team from the Southern <unk> , and the longest in the history of the sport .
By the time the &lt; unk &gt; returned to New Zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number of <unk> <unk> .

The tour also prompted the <unk> formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union ( &lt; unk &gt; , later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union ) in <unk> ; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring New Zealand sides .

Although some musical critics <unk> her decision to include <unk> music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious <unk> among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .
&lt; unk &gt; continued to present music that was thought <unk> of by conservative audiences .
On some occasions , such as her performances of &lt; unk &gt; in New York in 1923 and <unk> , as well as in London in <unk> , this was quite successful .

This was not even the first notice of the expedition to the <unk> ; a letter <unk> in December had already provided intelligence that the British were planning to go to the South .
Clinton arrived at Cape Fear on March 12 , <unk> to find the European convoy already there .
He met with the royal governors of North and South Carolina , <unk> Martin and William <unk> , and learned that the recruited Scottish &lt; unk &gt; had been defeated at Moore &apos; s Creek Bridge two weeks earlier .

A large vessel <unk> into Charleston first had to cross Charleston <unk> , a series of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; lying about 8 miles ( 13 km ) southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan &apos; s Island as it entered the channel to the inner <unk> .
Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island , where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city .
&lt; unk &gt; and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan &apos; s Island in March 1776 , and began construction of a <unk> to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor .
The construction moved slowly ; Captain Peter &lt; unk &gt; of the &lt; unk &gt; naval detachment described the site as &quot; an <unk> <unk> 500 feet long , and 16 feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot &quot; .

He headed for Charleston , saying &quot; &#91; I &#93; <unk> I know not whether I <unk> go to or from the enemy . &quot;
He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the <unk> , and took command of the city &apos; s defenses .

By June 8 , most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , an <unk> between the bar and the <unk> entrance .
With the fort on Sullivan &apos; s Island only half complete , Admiral Parker expressed <unk> that his warships would easily <unk> its walls .
&lt; unk &gt; believing he would not even need Clinton &apos; s land forces , he wrote to Clinton that after the fort &apos; s guns were knocked out , he would &quot; land &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> ( which I have <unk> for the purpose ) under the guns &quot; and that they could &quot; keep possession till you send as many troops as you think <unk> &quot; .

On June 7 , Clinton issued a <unk> calling on the <unk> <unk> to lay down their arms .
However , the <unk> defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it ( which was flying a <unk> flag ) , and it was not delivered until the next day .
That same day , Clinton began landing 2 @ , @ 200 troops on Long Island .
The <unk> was that these troops would &lt; unk &gt; across the channel ( now known as &lt; unk &gt; <unk> ) between Long and Sullivan &apos; s , which the British believed to be <unk> shallow to do so , while the fleet <unk> Fort Sullivan .
General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions .
He began <unk> positions on the mainland in case the British were <unk> to launch an attack directly on Charleston .
He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an &lt; unk &gt; of retreat for the fort &apos; s garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile ( 1 @ .
@ 6 km ) channel <unk> the island from Charleston ; the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; to support the effort may also have played a role .
The Americans also constructed an &lt; unk &gt; at the northern end of Sullivan &apos; s Island , which was <unk> by more than 750 men and three small <unk> , and began to &lt; unk &gt; a guard post at &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan .
General Clinton encountered the first major <unk> of the attack plan on June 17 .
An attempt to &lt; unk &gt; the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least <unk> @ - @ deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the <unk> of enemy opposition .
He considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the Americans , with <unk> <unk> from General Lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was <unk> impossible to <unk> from ships or the Long Island position .
As a result , the British and American forces faced each other across the channel , <unk> in <unk> and largely &lt; unk &gt; <unk> fire at long range .
Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have &quot; the <unk> of being defeated alone . &quot;
The attack was originally planned for June 24 , but bad weather and <unk> wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days .
= = Battle = = On the morning of June 28 , Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel &lt; unk &gt; , commanding the 2nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the 4th South Carolina <unk> , numbering <unk> men .
At around 9 : 00 am that morning , a British ship fired a <unk> gun <unk> all was ready for the attack .

Each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire .
Although many of Thunder &apos; s shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to &lt; unk &gt; , &quot; We had a &lt; unk &gt; in the middle , that <unk> them up <unk> , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried &quot; .
Thunder &apos; s role in the action was also relatively short @ - @ lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the &lt; unk &gt; of her <unk> with extra <unk> to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> of <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s men were <unk> in the <unk> of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the <unk> .
They also fired in small &lt; unk &gt; , four <unk> at a time .
One British <unk> wrote , &quot; Their fire was <unk> well served &quot; and it was &quot; slow , but <unk> <unk> ; they were very <unk> and took care not to fire except their guns were <unk> well directed . &quot;
General Clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of Sullivan &apos; s Island .

Around <unk> the frigates &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; were sent on a <unk> route , <unk> some &lt; unk &gt; , to take a position from which they could <unk> the fort &apos; s main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort .
However , all three ships grounded on an &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , and the &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; became <unk> in the process .
The British managed to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , but &lt; unk &gt; remained grounded , having moved too far onto the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Consequently , none of these ships reached its intended position , a piece of good <unk> not lost on Colonel &lt; unk &gt; : &quot; <unk> these three ships <unk> their purpose , they would have &lt; unk &gt; us in such a <unk> , as to have driven us from our guns . &quot;
At the fort , &lt; unk &gt; ordered his men to <unk> their fire on the two large man @ - @ of @ - @ war ships , Bristol and <unk> , which took hit after hit from the fort &apos; s guns .

One round hit her <unk> , slightly <unk> Parker in the knee and <unk> .
The shot also <unk> off part of his &lt; unk &gt; , leaving his &lt; unk &gt; exposed .
By mid @ - @ afternoon , the defenders were running out of <unk> , and their fire was briefly suspended .
However , Lee sent more ammunition and <unk> over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships ; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day , <unk> Colonel &lt; unk &gt; , &quot; I see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion for me , I will go up to the town again . &quot;
Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort &apos; s walls with <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
This strategy failed due to the &lt; unk &gt; nature of the &lt; unk &gt; wood used in its <unk> ; the structure would &lt; unk &gt; , and it <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; rather than &lt; unk &gt; .
The exchange continued until around 9 : 00 <unk> , when <unk> forced a <unk> of hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out of range .

The British troops were &lt; unk &gt; on their transports , and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew <unk> to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City .
To add <unk> to injury , one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by &lt; unk &gt; forces .
The British did not return to Charleston until &lt; unk &gt; , when General Clinton successfully <unk> the city and captured an entire army .
Until the South again became a focus of the war in late <unk> , its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard <unk> to <unk> the war effort .
Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle , each seeking to cast the <unk> on the other for the expedition &apos; s <unk> .
Although Clinton was not <unk> by the government , popular opinion held him responsible , and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery .
= = Legacy = = Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort &lt; unk &gt; shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William &lt; unk &gt; for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston .
&lt; unk &gt; modified in the years after the battle , it was &lt; unk &gt; by Fort &lt; unk &gt; as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War .
In <unk> , to celebrate the <unk> , companies from <unk> , <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , Columbia , New York and Boston were invited to Charleston .
The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960 , and is now part of Fort &lt; unk &gt; National <unk> .
A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan &apos; s Island has been placed at the <unk> tip of the island , <unk> the <unk> where General Clinton &apos; s soldiers had <unk> to cross .
The monument includes historical <unk> describing the events surrounding the engagement .
One <unk> emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white <unk> in the top left corner , which was <unk> at the fort during the battle .
Despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a <unk> of this successful defense ( and <unk> raised during victory ) .
It came to be known as the &lt; unk &gt; flag or <unk> <unk> .
When Charleston ( lost to the British in the &lt; unk &gt; siege ) was <unk> by American forces at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the city by General &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
= Hu &lt; unk &gt; = Hu &lt; unk &gt; ( Chinese : &lt; unk &gt; ; c .
&lt; unk &gt; – <unk> ) was a Chinese artist , &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> .
He worked in calligraphy , traditional Chinese painting , and seal @ - @ carving , but was primarily a <unk> , producing academic texts as well as records of his own work .
Hu lived in &lt; unk &gt; during the <unk> from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty .
A Ming <unk> , he was offered a position at the <unk> court of the &lt; unk &gt; Emperor , but declined the post , and never held anything more than minor political office .
He did , however , design the &lt; unk &gt; Emperor &apos; s personal seal , and his <unk> to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor &apos; s capture and death in <unk> .
He owned and operated an academic <unk> house called the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio , in which he <unk> various multi @ - @ colour printing and &lt; unk &gt; techniques , and he employed several members of his family in this <unk> .
Hu &apos; s work at the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio <unk> new techniques in colour &lt; unk &gt; , leading to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of colour which were not previously &lt; unk &gt; in this art form .
Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio Manual of <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; , an artist &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; which remained in <unk> for around 200 years .
His studio also published seal <unk> , academic and medical texts , books on poetry , and decorative writing <unk> .
Many of these were edited and <unk> by Hu and his brothers .
= = <unk> = = Hu was born in &lt; unk &gt; County , <unk> Province in &lt; unk &gt; or early &lt; unk &gt; .
Both his father and <unk> brother &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; , art name &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) were &lt; unk &gt; , and after he turned 30 he travelled with them while they <unk> <unk> in the areas around <unk> &apos; an and &lt; unk &gt; .
It is commonly stated that &lt; unk &gt; himself was also a <unk> , though the earliest sources &lt; unk &gt; to this occur only in the second half of the 19th century .
By <unk> , Hu had moved to &lt; unk &gt; where he lived with his wife <unk> .
Their home on &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; , now also known as &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) , a hill located just within the northern city wall , served as a meeting @ - @ house for like @ - @ <unk> artists .
Hu named it the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio ( &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , after the ten <unk> plants that grew in front of the property .
It <unk> as the headquarters for his printing business , where he employed ten <unk> including his two brothers &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; , art name &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) and his sons &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) and &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> name &lt; unk &gt; ) .
During Hu &apos; s <unk> , the Ming dynasty , which had ruled China for over 250 years , was <unk> and replaced by China &apos; s last imperial dynasty , the Qing .
Following the fall of the capital Beijing in <unk> , remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a Ming <unk> <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; with <unk> &lt; unk &gt; on the throne as the &lt; unk &gt; Emperor .
Hu , who was noted for his seal @ - @ carving and facility with seal script , created a seal for the new Emperor .
The court offered him the position of &lt; unk &gt; for the &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) as a <unk> , but he did not accept the role ( although he did <unk> himself the title of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in some of his subsequent personal seals ) .
According to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Lost History of the South ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , prior to the Qing invasion of &lt; unk &gt; Hu studied at the National University there , and <unk> a <unk> was employed by the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; to record official &lt; unk &gt; ; he produced the Imperial <unk> of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) and the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; ) as part of this work .
As a result , he was promoted to the <unk> of Personnel and gained &lt; unk &gt; to the &lt; unk &gt; Academy , but before he could take up this appointment , Beijing had <unk> to the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Since <unk> <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s work was not published until <unk> ) make no mention of these events , it has been suggested that they were <unk> after Hu &apos; s death .
Hu retired from public life and went into <unk> in <unk> , after the end of the Ming dynasty .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; recorded visiting him during his later years , in <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; respectively .
He died in <unk> at the age of 90 , <unk> around late &lt; unk &gt; or early <unk> .
= = <unk> @ - @ carving = = Hu &lt; unk &gt; was a noted seal @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; , producing personal seals for numerous <unk> .
His style was <unk> in the classical seal script of the <unk> dynasty , and he followed the &lt; unk &gt; school of carving founded by his contemporary He &lt; unk &gt; .
Hu &apos; s calligraphy , although <unk> and with a clear &lt; unk &gt; structure , is somewhat more <unk> and <unk> than the classical <unk> he followed .
&lt; unk &gt; seals attempt to &lt; unk &gt; an ancient , <unk> impression , although <unk> other &lt; unk &gt; artists Hu did not make a regular practice of <unk> aging his seals .
Hu &apos; s work was known outside his local area .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; , a <unk> who lived in &lt; unk &gt; around the same time as Hu and was a noted art &lt; unk &gt; , stated in his <unk> of <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) that Hu &quot; <unk> <unk> stone <unk> with ancient seal inscriptions for <unk> to fight over and treasure &quot; , <unk> that his <unk> were popular with visitors and <unk> passing through &lt; unk &gt; .
In <unk> , Hu took it upon himself to create a new Imperial seal for the &lt; unk &gt; Emperor , which he carved after a period of &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> .
He presented his creation with an essay , the Great &lt; unk &gt; of the <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , in which he &lt; unk &gt; the loss of the &lt; unk &gt; Emperor &apos; s seal and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &apos; s favour in <unk> it .
Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of <unk> , equally @ - @ <unk> <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) used in the Imperial <unk> , but his submission and the seal itself were <unk> both accepted by the Southern Ming court .
= = Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio = = Despite his reputation as an artist and seal @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; , Hu was primarily a <unk> .
His <unk> house , the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio , produced reference works on calligraphy , poetry and art ; medical <unk> ; books on <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; ; and copies of as well as <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
Unlike other <unk> in the area , the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio did not <unk> works of <unk> <unk> such as plays or <unk> .
This <unk> towards <unk> was likely a consequence of the studio &apos; s location : the mountain on which Hu took up <unk> was just to the north of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( National Academy ) , which provided a captive market for academic texts .
Between <unk> and <unk> , the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind , aimed at a <unk> , <unk> audience .
The studio &apos; s earliest publications were medical <unk> , the first of which , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; for &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) was published in <unk> and proved popular enough to be <unk> ten years later .
Hu &apos; s brother &lt; unk &gt; was a medical &lt; unk &gt; and appears to have been the author of these books .
During the &lt; unk &gt; the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio also produced political works &lt; unk &gt; the rule of the Ming ; these included the Imperial Ming <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; ( <unk> Ming &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; ) , a <unk> of <unk> Ming officials , and the &lt; unk &gt; of the Imperial Ming ( <unk> Ming &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , a list of Imperial &lt; unk &gt; .
After the fall of the Ming <unk> , Hu renamed the studio the Hall &lt; unk &gt; in the Past ( &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) as a sign of his <unk> with the previous dynasty , although the Ten &lt; unk &gt; <unk> continued to be used .
Despite Hu &apos; s withdrawal from society after <unk> , the studio continued to <unk> well into the Qing dynasty , for the most part &lt; unk &gt; on seal impression <unk> <unk> Hu &apos; s carving work .
The Ming dynasty had seen considerable <unk> in the process of colour printing in China .
At his studio , Hu &lt; unk &gt; <unk> with various forms of &lt; unk &gt; printing , creating <unk> for producing multi @ - @ <unk> <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; printed designs .
As a result , he was able to produce some of China &apos; s first printed publications in colour , using a block printing technique known as &quot; &lt; unk &gt; block printing &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) .
This system made use of multiple blocks , each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour .
It was a lengthy , &lt; unk &gt; process , requiring thirty to <unk> <unk> printing blocks and up to <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> to create a single image .
Hu also employed a related form of multiple @ - @ block printing called &quot; set @ - @ block printing &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , which had <unk> since the Yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again .
He <unk> these block printing techniques by developing a process for &lt; unk &gt; some of the <unk> off the blocks before printing ; this <unk> him to achieve &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> which were not previously possible .
In some images , Hu employed a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; technique ( known as &quot; &lt; unk &gt; designs &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) or &quot; &lt; unk &gt; blocks &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , using an &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; block to <unk> designs onto paper .
He used this to create white relief effects for <unk> and for highlights on water or plants .
This was a relatively new process , having been <unk> by Hu &apos; s contemporary <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , who was also a &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ based <unk> .
<unk> had used this technique for the first time in his book <unk> Studio &lt; unk &gt; Paper ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , published in &lt; unk &gt; .
Both Hu and <unk> used &lt; unk &gt; to create decorative writing <unk> , the sale of which provided a &lt; unk &gt; income for the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio .
= = Major works = = Hu &apos; s most notable work is the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio Manual of <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , an <unk> of around <unk> <unk> by around thirty different artists ( including Hu himself ) , published in <unk> .
It consists of eight sections , <unk> calligraphy , <unk> , <unk> , rocks , <unk> and animals , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Some of these sections had been released previously as single <unk> .
As well as a collection of <unk> , it was also intended as an <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , with instructions on <unk> <unk> position and technique and several <unk> designed for &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> .
Although these instructions only appear in the sections on <unk> and <unk> , the book still remains the first example of a &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> approach to Chinese painting .
In this book , Hu used his multiple @ - @ block printing methods to obtain &lt; unk &gt; of colour in the images , rather than obvious <unk> or <unk> .
The manual is bound in the &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) style , <unk> whole @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> are <unk> so that each <unk> a double @ - @ <unk> spread .
This <unk> style allows the <unk> to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image .
Cambridge University Library released a complete digital <unk> of the manual , including all writings and <unk> in August , 2015 .
Said Charles &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> of the Cambridge University Chinese Department , &quot; The <unk> is so <unk> , and the manual so <unk> , that until it was &lt; unk &gt; , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its &lt; unk &gt; importance to scholars . &quot;
This volume went on to influence colour printing across China , where it <unk> the way for the later but better @ - @ known Manual of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Garden ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) , and also in Japan , where it was <unk> and <unk> the development in &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ e of the colour &lt; unk &gt; printing process known as &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ e &lt; unk &gt; .
The popularity of the Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio Manual was such that <unk> runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late Qing dynasty .
Hu also produced the work Ten &lt; unk &gt; Studio &lt; unk &gt; Paper ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , a collection of paper <unk> , which made use of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; technique to make the <unk> stand out in relief .
<unk> primarily a <unk> of decorative writing <unk> , it also contained <unk> of rocks , people , ritual vessels and other <unk> .
The book was bound in the &quot; wrapped back &quot; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) style , in which the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> are <unk> , <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; along the open edges .
Originally published in <unk> , it was <unk> in four <unk> between 1934 and 1941 by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , and <unk> and <unk> again in 1952 .
= = = Other publications = = = Other works produced by Hu &apos; s studio included a <unk> of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s manual of seal @ - @ script calligraphy , The Six &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) and the related &lt; unk &gt; <unk> into &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; ) , which discussed common <unk> in the formation of characters .
With his brother &lt; unk &gt; , Hu edited a new <unk> edition of the <unk> <unk> , entitled The &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of the Four Books , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) ( <unk> ) , giving the <unk> formation and <unk> of the text .
A similar approach was taken with the &lt; unk &gt; of the <unk> <unk> Classic in Six &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) ( <unk> ) , which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
It was published after <unk> &apos; s death , partly in <unk> to him .
The three Hu brothers worked together to &lt; unk &gt; a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; on poetry by their contemporary &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , which was called simply the &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; ) ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
Other works on poetry from the studio included &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; to the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> <unk> <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) , which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included &lt; unk &gt; by Hu &lt; unk &gt; himself .
Among the studio &apos; s more obscure publications was a text on Chinese &lt; unk &gt; entitled &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , written under a <unk> but with a <unk> by Hu &lt; unk &gt; .

Spain had transformed from an ally of Great Britain in the War of the First <unk> into an enemy in 1796 .
<unk> the presence of a powerful Spanish squadron at Manila posed a threat to the China Fleet , an annual convoy of East &lt; unk &gt; merchant ships from &lt; unk &gt; in Qing <unk> China to Britain , which was of vital economic importance to Britain .
So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during 1797 , but had been called off following the Treaty of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of <unk> .
To ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at &lt; unk &gt; in the winter of 1797 – 98 , the British commander in the East Indies , <unk> @ - @ Admiral Peter &lt; unk &gt; , sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS &lt; unk &gt; and HMS Fox and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke .
After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of <unk> of Spanish forces in Manila himself .
He was also <unk> by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila , which would make a valuable <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; in &lt; unk &gt; and accompanied by Captain <unk> Malcolm in Fox , Cooke reached the Spanish capital on 13 January 1798 .
&lt; unk &gt; in Manila Bay , Cooke <unk> that his ships were French vessels and successfully <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of Spanish officials aboard , taking them prisoner in turn .
Once he had determined from his <unk> the state of defences in Manila , that the treasure ship had been &lt; unk &gt; at &lt; unk &gt; and that the Spanish squadron was <unk> extensive repairs and thus <unk> for operations , he sent a <unk> party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the &lt; unk &gt; River .
&lt; unk &gt; the gunboats in a <unk> attack , Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed <unk> , <unk> assaulting &lt; unk &gt; before returning to &lt; unk &gt; .
= = Background = = In 1796 , after three years of the French Revolutionary Wars , Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San &lt; unk &gt; .
The secret terms of this treaty required Spain to <unk> its <unk> with Great Britain and subsequently to <unk> war on its former ally .
In the East Indies this shift of political <unk> meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east .
Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796 , controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Dutch <unk> , the Dutch Cape <unk> and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in <unk> , and the French presence in the region had been <unk> to <unk> de France and a few <unk> islands in the Western Indian Ocean .
Some of the most important trade routes began at &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; in Qing <unk> China .
Early in each year a large convoy known as the &quot; China Fleet &quot; , composed of large East &lt; unk &gt; merchant ships in the <unk> of the British East India Company , sailed &lt; unk &gt; to Europe from &lt; unk &gt; <unk> with <unk> and other commercial cargo .
This convoy was <unk> significant to Britain : one convoy in <unk> was <unk> at over £ 8 million ( the equivalent of £ 600 @ , @ 000 @ , @ 000 as of <unk> ) .
In January 1797 the convoy had been attacked by the French squadron in the East Indies , <unk> six frigates commanded by &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> Charles de &lt; unk &gt; .

There was considerable concern in India that &lt; unk &gt; might try again in 1798 , or that the Spanish , who maintained a powerful squadron at &lt; unk &gt; , might make an attempt of their own .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s initial <unk> on learning in November 1796 of the <unk> declaration of war between Britain and Spain was to <unk> up plans for a major invasion of the Philippines , <unk> on Manila in <unk> of the successful British capture of Manila in &lt; unk &gt; .

Britain now faced France and Spain alone , while &lt; unk &gt; from the <unk> <unk> of the Kingdom of <unk> , an old opponent of Britain in Southern India , were seeking French assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities .
The resources planned for the operation against Manila were therefore retained in India and the operation <unk> , but the protection of the China Fleet was still essential and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> some of his squadron <unk> to China .
A number of merchant ships had <unk> at <unk> in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> trade goods and join the China Fleet .

The Spanish squadron had suffered badly in a <unk> in April 1797 and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time Cooke &apos; s small squadron arrived off Manila .

Cooke then joined the party on the deck of Fox , claiming to be <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , a French officer who , unknown to the Spanish , had been killed in the <unk> of 9 September 1796 off <unk> .
The Spanish officer was now completely convinced by the &lt; unk &gt; , which had been <unk> by fake French <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; the <unk> below <unk> , Cooke then passed <unk> around and together they <unk> a series of &lt; unk &gt; , including &quot; the <unk> of England &quot; .
For an hour the officers <unk> , Malcolm and Cooke learning <unk> information about the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to &lt; unk &gt; the French &lt; unk &gt; .
This vessel was the personal <unk> of the Spanish commander at &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> @ - @ Admiral Don &lt; unk &gt; <unk> de &lt; unk &gt; , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an <unk> in a third boat .
Each time , the officers were escorted below to join the <unk> <unk> their crews were seized at &lt; unk &gt; and taken below <unk> as prisoners of war .
In Malcolm &apos; s <unk> , the captured officers were <unk> of their situation , promised release before the British frigates sailed , and offered more <unk> .
The crew of Fox <unk> forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and &lt; unk &gt; their clothing .
&lt; unk &gt; into the Spanish boats this party <unk> for the mouth of the nearby &lt; unk &gt; River , where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were <unk> .

These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well @ - @ armed , one with a 32 @ - @ pounder long gun and two with 24 @ - @ pounder long guns , each <unk> by four &lt; unk &gt; guns .
The harbour captain reached Fox shortly afterwards , furious at the <unk> of the gunboats and <unk> they be returned .
Malcolm received him with a &lt; unk &gt; of near <unk> French and brought him to join the other captured officers in his <unk> , while the boat &apos; s crew were imprisoned below <unk> .
Shortly afterwards , at 16 : 00 , Cooke and Malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer <unk> and sent food and &lt; unk &gt; to the crew , the total number of Spanish sailors on Fox now numbering approximately 200 .
Once the <unk> was finished , Cooke allowed all of the <unk> to return to their boats and row for <unk> without the conditions of <unk> , although he retained the captured gunboats .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; = = = Cooke led his small squadron past &lt; unk &gt; on 15 January and turned south .
Four days later in a storm one of the gunboats broke its <unk> line and was never seen again , lost with its twelve crew .
The frigates subsequently <unk> &lt; unk &gt; before reaching &lt; unk &gt; on 22 January .
There Cooke raised Spanish <unk> in an attempt to &lt; unk &gt; the authorities into <unk> food and water to his squadron but &lt; unk &gt; grounded on a &lt; unk &gt; at the entrance to the port which raised the <unk> of a &lt; unk &gt; sent by the governor of &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The captain of the Spanish boat asked the British ships the names of their <unk> , and on receiving no <unk> but a <unk> of rifle fire , he put the town on <unk> .
With the defenders &lt; unk &gt; , Cooke abandoned his &lt; unk &gt; and after &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; the following morning , ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour .
This had little effect , though later the Spanish recovered at least <unk> &lt; unk &gt; from different &lt; unk &gt; , and Malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the &lt; unk &gt; side of the fort .
The boats came under heavy fire , one <unk> by a &lt; unk &gt; , killing two and <unk> four .
Another boat grounded on a &lt; unk &gt; and became <unk> ; so with his force in &lt; unk &gt; , as 250 <unk> armed with <unk> <unk> and drove the British from the <unk> , Malcolm called off the operation .
After <unk> shot for an hour both frigates cut their <unk> <unk> and retreated out of range , with two dead and one wounded on &lt; unk &gt; and eight wounded on Fox , in addition to those lost in the boats .
The defenders lost a single man killed and 4 wounded .
With his frigates now requiring repairs , Cooke withdraw half a <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; and spent three days &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> and <unk> of the ships .
Then he sailed north , <unk> the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to &lt; unk &gt; .
Four days later , on 27 January the squadron halted at a village named &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; in the north of the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> fresh water .

More might have been achieved with reinforcements : <unk> C. &lt; unk &gt; <unk> suggests that had Cooke &apos; s squadron <unk> with Resistance together they may have been able to destroy the <unk> Spanish warships at &lt; unk &gt; .
He also notes however that in this <unk> &lt; unk &gt; would have been commanding officer , a man with <unk> less <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; than Cooke .

In February 2009 , Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage .
Despite the <unk> of storage and potential &lt; unk &gt; , the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal .

The artwork had been <unk> &lt; unk &gt; by the <unk> after the popular children &apos; s game from the 1970s .
Prior to the construction of &lt; unk &gt; at the University of <unk> , B of the Bang was Britain &apos; s tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the Angel of the North , which stands at 66 feet ( 20 m ) .
It was designed to look like an <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and was <unk> and <unk> at a greater <unk> than the &lt; unk &gt; Tower of &lt; unk &gt; .

It was approved at the start of 2003 , with the central core arriving in Manchester on 13 June 2004 .
This was the largest <unk> that could be transferred via road from the <unk> , and required a police escort .
This central core was <unk> into place in August 2004 , after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached .

At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and <unk> near the sculpture were temporarily closed .
As a result , some of the <unk> were re @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; , with equipment put in place to prevent <unk> movement .
This consisted of &lt; unk &gt; tip <unk> to 70 % of the spikes &apos; <unk> .
Despite these <unk> , B of the Bang remained &lt; unk &gt; off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to &apos; Get It &lt; unk &gt; &apos; .
In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for &lt; unk &gt; analysis , to <unk> the <unk> being placed on the steel .

= Battle of the &lt; unk &gt; River = The Battle of the &lt; unk &gt; River took place during the Second World War and involved Australian , New Zealand and Japanese forces .
Part of the wider &lt; unk &gt; Campaign of the Pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of &lt; unk &gt; Island .
<unk> after the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Knoll in which a strong Japanese <unk> was defeated , the battle occurred in two distinct <unk> between 17 April and 22 May 1945 , as elements of the Australian 15th Brigade advanced south along the &lt; unk &gt; Road .
The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the &lt; unk &gt; River .
Following the end of the early fighting , the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at &lt; unk &gt; continued as they struck out towards the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
This continued until <unk> rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , &lt; unk &gt; away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians <unk> for supplies .
As the Australian advance <unk> , the Japanese began <unk> the Australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding <unk> in late @ - @ July and into August , the Australians began making <unk> to resume the advance towards &lt; unk &gt; again .

= = Background = = = = = <unk> situation = = = Japanese forces had landed on &lt; unk &gt; in early 1942 , capturing it from the small force of Australians &lt; unk &gt; the island .
They had subsequently developed several &lt; unk &gt; on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of <unk> between the United States , Australia and the <unk> Pacific Area .
These bases also helped protect Rabaul , the major Japanese garrison and naval base in <unk> New Guinea , and throughout 1943 , Allied <unk> determined that &lt; unk &gt; was vital for &lt; unk &gt; the Japanese base around Rabaul .
US Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape &lt; unk &gt; , on the western coast of the island , north of <unk> <unk> Bay , in November 1943 .
After an initial counter @ - @ attack , the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began <unk> their position around &lt; unk &gt; , establishing a strong perimeter .
In March 1944 , the Japanese launched a heavy counter @ - @ attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties .
After this , the situation on &lt; unk &gt; became largely <unk> , as the Japanese focused primarily on <unk> , and the US forces chose to <unk> a mainly defensive <unk> focused on maintaining the perimeter around &lt; unk &gt; .
In late 1944 , as part of plans to free US troops up for the Philippines campaign , the Australian II Corps — consisting of mainly <unk> troops under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley &lt; unk &gt; — took over responsibility for Allied operations on &lt; unk &gt; from the American <unk> Corps .
Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December 1944 , initially establishing themselves around the US base at &lt; unk &gt; .
Due to <unk> intelligence , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17 @ , @ 500 men , and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from &lt; unk &gt; in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere , rather than maintaining the defensive <unk> the US forces had adopted .
However , Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be <unk> <unk> and after the war it was found that the number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40 @ , @ 000 .
The campaign that Australian <unk> developed <unk> three separate <unk> : in the north , it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; Peninsula and contained ; in the centre the <unk> of <unk> Ridge would give the Australians control of the east – west <unk> of approach , as well as &lt; unk &gt; them protection against further counter @ - @ attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around &lt; unk &gt; .

In late March and early April 1945 , they had fought the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Knoll after which a brief <unk> followed as the Australians <unk> to <unk> their supply lines .
Meanwhile , the survivors of the Japanese force , heavily <unk> by their defeat , withdrew towards the &lt; unk &gt; River .
The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the &lt; unk &gt; River , while the &lt; unk &gt; was also included as an &quot; intermediate objective &quot; .
Japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about 10 @ , @ 500 men , of which 2 @ , @ 300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd Division .
The 15th Brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the Australian units on &lt; unk &gt; at the time and was moved up to <unk> the 7th Brigade , which was in need of rest .
Under the command of <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; the 15th Brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the 2 / 4th <unk> Regiment , engineers from the 15th Field Company , a battery of <unk> @ - @ mm guns from &apos; <unk> &apos; Heavy <unk> , field artillery from the 2nd Field Regiment , and a number of smaller support units .
The &lt; unk &gt; / 59th Infantry Battalion took over responsibility for &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Knoll replacing the 25th Infantry Battalion while the 24th Infantry Battalion took up a position across the &lt; unk &gt; Road .
The brigade &apos; s third battalion — the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion — did not join them until the beginning of May , and so the 7th Brigade &apos; s 9th Infantry Battalion continued patrolling operations north of the &lt; unk &gt; River , in the &lt; unk &gt; area , until the 57th / 60th could <unk> elements to <unk> them .
Further inland , the 2 / 8th Commando Squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south @ - @ east , defending the brigade &apos; s left , or eastern , flank .

&lt; unk &gt; had been ordered to delay the Australian advance between the &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; for as long as possible , and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the Australian &apos; s expected line of advance .
The division &apos; s infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be <unk> or <unk> .
The front line positions were assigned to the 6th Field <unk> Regiment , while the 13th Infantry Regiment was to hold five &lt; unk &gt; to their rear along and &lt; unk &gt; the &lt; unk &gt; Road , designated &apos; A &apos; through to &apos; E &apos; .
The 6th Field and 4th Field Heavy <unk> <unk> both held &lt; unk &gt; further back , designated &apos; F &apos; and &apos; <unk> &apos; .

Two days later , &lt; unk &gt; received the order to <unk> the advance towards the &lt; unk &gt; from &lt; unk &gt; , who offered him the support of the 29th Brigade as a mobile reserve in case of <unk> counter @ - @ attack .
In a change to the tactics that the Australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Knoll , from early May they advanced on a two @ - @ battalion front , instead of one .
The 24th Infantry Battalion was in the van , moving along the &lt; unk &gt; Road with the &lt; unk &gt; / 59th protecting its flank and rear ; while 5 @ , @ 000 yd ( 4 @ , @ 600 m ) further inland the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion , <unk> on 3 May , advanced along the Commando Road from &lt; unk &gt; , after taking over from the 9th Infantry Battalion .
Moving forward under a &lt; unk &gt; barrage as they moved beyond &lt; unk &gt; , the 24th Infantry Battalion was the first to contact the Japanese , carrying out an attack against Japanese positions around &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Creek on 17 April .
&lt; unk &gt; by a troop of <unk> tanks from the 2 / 4th <unk> Regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry companies — &apos; C &apos; and &apos; D &apos; — from the 24th attacked the position while another — &apos; A &apos; Company — carried out a <unk> <unk> to cut another track further north towards &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
The left forward company — &apos; D &apos; Company — reached its objective without trouble ; however , &apos; C &apos; Company — on the right along with the troop of tanks — came up against <unk> Japanese resistance and became <unk> down . &apos;
A &apos; Company also became <unk> in heavy fighting along the &lt; unk &gt; track .
In support of &apos; A &apos; Company , &lt; unk &gt; came forward and <unk> the jungle , <unk> through the &lt; unk &gt; to reveal several Japanese &lt; unk &gt; , which were destroyed by the Australian armour .
As night fell , &apos; C &apos; Company <unk> in before <unk> the attack the next morning .
<unk> were brought forward , as was a &lt; unk &gt; , and the gap was &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; heavy fighting , the Australians forced their way across the creek .
By the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of <unk> 400 yd ( 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 Japanese had been killed for the loss of seven Australians killed and 19 wounded .
After this , the Australians continued their advance towards &lt; unk &gt; Creek , which was a further 1 mi ( 1 @ .
@ 6 km ) to the southeast .
In response , the Japanese launched a number of determined <unk> over the course of the following week , although these were turned back .
During this time , the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , one of which managed to <unk> through the Japanese defensive positions either side of the &lt; unk &gt; Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the &lt; unk &gt; River about 1 @ , @ 000 yd ( 910 m ) south of the main crossing .
Further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of <unk> , before the advance was resumed on 26 April .
&lt; unk &gt; their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of &lt; unk &gt; from the Royal New Zealand Air Force — <unk>
14 , 22 and 26 <unk> — which bombed and &lt; unk &gt; the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a &lt; unk &gt; barrage of artillery and mortar fire .
With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the &lt; unk &gt; , for just one man wounded .
Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a <unk> defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
After this , the 15th Brigade &apos; s engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route <unk> and <unk> operations as the Japanese became increasingly <unk> to destroy the Australian armour , to the <unk> that they were prepared to <unk> an artillery piece in order to <unk> the Australian tanks into a <unk> where they could be destroyed by mines .
The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also .
To &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support .
Additionally , the Japanese began to <unk> their artillery with increasing <unk> upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under <unk> <unk> and fire .
Meanwhile , the previous day , 3 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north .
Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their <unk> in patrolling , which resulted in them being <unk> .
They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on 6 May .
On 5 May , along the &lt; unk &gt; Road , the 24th Infantry Battalion had <unk> forward again .
&lt; unk &gt; with a tank troop in support , they came up against a <unk> field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese .
After the lead <unk> &apos; s machine gun <unk> , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and <unk> its crew .
Moving around the <unk> tank , the second <unk> , armed with a <unk> , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before <unk> the Japanese defenders from the position .
That night , the Japanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company @ - @ <unk> counter @ - @ attack .
The fighting lasted for over two @ - @ and @ - @ a @ - @ half hours , but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack .
In doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed .
It was the <unk> loss since the action at &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Knoll and it <unk> the end of their attempt to defend the &lt; unk &gt; .
After this , the Australians were able to resume their advance to the river on 7 May without further opposition .
The previous three weeks in which they had advanced 7 @ , @ 000 yd ( 6 @ , @ 400 m ) to the &lt; unk &gt; had been <unk> for them , however , with the Australian 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded .
Against this , the Japanese had lost at least <unk> killed .
= = = Crossing the &lt; unk &gt; = = = Following the advance to the &lt; unk &gt; , there was a <unk> of about a week as the Australians had to <unk> for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
This allowed &lt; unk &gt; to re @ - @ <unk> the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
As they <unk> for the advance to resume , the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant <unk> during this time .
As a part of these , the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the &lt; unk &gt; and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main Australian axis of advance .
The main crossing was planned for 20 May , with the &lt; unk &gt; / 59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the &lt; unk &gt; Road and the &lt; unk &gt; Track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion would <unk> the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line , crossing at the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , advancing straight up the &lt; unk &gt; Road .
<unk> <unk> began before this , and on 15 May a platoon from the 24th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Ridge .
After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw .
Meanwhile , the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; squadrons — now reinforced by No .
16 Squadron — began an eight @ - @ day <unk> campaign , attacking along the length of the &lt; unk &gt; and Commando <unk> .
During this period , the New Zealanders flew <unk> <unk> , while artillery and <unk> fired &quot; thousands of <unk> &quot; .
Two days later , on 17 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion began its <unk> move on the left flank , crossing the &lt; unk &gt; inland and advancing along the Commando Road with 32 &lt; unk &gt; and two <unk> of artillery in support .
Crossing 500 yd ( <unk> m ) north of the &lt; unk &gt; , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to <unk> the crossing .
Nevertheless , shortly before <unk> they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further <unk> <unk> before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 May .
In the centre , the main attack along the &lt; unk &gt; Road began at <unk> : 30 on 20 May after 20 minutes of &lt; unk &gt; by New Zealand &lt; unk &gt; had prepared the ground .
&lt; unk &gt; under a &lt; unk &gt; barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of <unk> tanks .
&lt; unk &gt; the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to <unk> @ - @ in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded .
The attack was resumed the following day , and the Australians were able to advance to the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the Japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground .
Finally , a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Ridge , which they found to be heavily <unk> and <unk> trapped .
<unk> and assault <unk> were called up to clear the feature .
On the right flank , the &lt; unk &gt; / 59th Infantry Battalion carried out a wide <unk> move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the &lt; unk &gt; by &lt; unk &gt; .
Beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had <unk> with the Japanese .
Meanwhile , using &lt; unk &gt; to <unk> the tanks through the mud , the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 : 00 on 20 May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , &lt; unk &gt; to the Japanese .
The following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to <unk> a creek crossing , and further delayed by <unk> resistance .
Later , after one of the battalion &apos; s patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition .
By 22 May , although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to <unk> and <unk> their line of communications , most of the Australian objectives had been secured and &lt; unk &gt; up operations began .
The last remaining defensive location before the &lt; unk &gt; was &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Ridge , where the Japanese were <unk> in <unk> .
A heavy <unk> and artillery bombardment <unk> the position and forced them to abandon the ridge .
It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry .
Within a short period of time the &lt; unk &gt; Road was subsequently opened , providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed , while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded .
= = Aftermath = = During the course of the fighting around the &lt; unk &gt; , the Australians lost 38 men killed and <unk> wounded , while the Japanese lost at least <unk> men killed .
Following the battle , the Australians continued their advance towards &lt; unk &gt; at the southern end of the island .
Throughout the remainder of the month and into June , the 15th Brigade advanced along the &lt; unk &gt; Road , crossing the &lt; unk &gt; on 10 June .
<unk> the river , the Japanese <unk> to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their <unk> food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep &lt; unk &gt; .
These were <unk> reduced with <unk> and artillery , and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed &lt; unk &gt; River before being relieved by <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos; s 29th Brigade in early July .
As the 29th Brigade advanced toward the &lt; unk &gt; River , <unk> rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt .
The height of the river rose 2 metres ( 6 @ .
@ 6 ft ) .
The &lt; unk &gt; Road was reduced , in the words of <unk> Long , &quot; to a sea of mud &quot; and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was <unk> were <unk> away .
This <unk> large @ - @ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation <unk> for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the &lt; unk &gt; ; <unk> , the Japanese continued to <unk> the Australians , <unk> their positions and setting mines and <unk> , <unk> the Australian line of communications .
On 9 July , the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around &lt; unk &gt; , at the junction of the &lt; unk &gt; River and the &lt; unk &gt; Road , which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment .
Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August .
These attacks proved very <unk> , particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with <unk> the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding .
Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also , and although <unk> in the south for the final advance towards &lt; unk &gt; continued into August , combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed .
As a result , the final Australian operations on &lt; unk &gt; took place on the &lt; unk &gt; front in the northern sector , where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the &lt; unk &gt; Peninsula .
By mid @ - @ August , however , following the dropping of two <unk> <unk> on &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; and Japan &apos; s subsequent <unk> surrender , a <unk> fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor <unk> following this , it <unk> an end to major combat operations .
Following the end of the war , the Australian Army awarded three battle <unk> for the fighting around the &lt; unk &gt; River .
The 2 / 4th <unk> Regiment , and the 9th , 24th , 57th / 60th and &lt; unk &gt; / 59th Infantry <unk> received the battle honour &quot; &lt; unk &gt; River &quot; .
A second battle honour — &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Ridge – &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &quot; — was also awarded to the 2 / 4th <unk> Regiment , and the 24th and &lt; unk &gt; / 59th Infantry <unk> for the second stage of the fighting , while the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion received the separate battle honour of &quot; Commando Road &quot; for this period .
= Sonic the Hedgehog ( 1991 video game ) = Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console .
The game was first released in North America , Europe and Australia in June 1991 , and in Japan the following month .
The game features an <unk> &lt; unk &gt; named Sonic in a <unk> to defeat Dr. &lt; unk &gt; , a <unk> who has imprisoned animals in <unk> and <unk> the <unk> Chaos &lt; unk &gt; .
Sonic the Hedgehog &apos; s gameplay involves <unk> rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single <unk> .
The game &apos; s development began in 1990 , when Sega ordered its &lt; unk &gt; development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company .
After considering a number of <unk> , the <unk> decided on a blue &lt; unk &gt; with spikes along his head and <unk> and renamed themselves &quot; Sonic Team &quot; to match their character .
Sonic the Hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was influenced by the games of Super Mario series <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic &apos; s <unk> to roll along <unk> <unk> , which <unk> in a <unk> demo created by the game &apos; s <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The game was well received by critics , who praised its <unk> , music , and speed of gameplay .
The game was also commercially successful , establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16 @ - @ bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super &lt; unk &gt; console .
It has been <unk> a number of times , and inspired several &lt; unk &gt; , a successful franchise , and <unk> by other media .
= = Plot = = In an attempt to <unk> the six Chaos &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; their power , the game &apos; s <unk> , Dr. <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive <unk> and <unk> metal <unk> .
The player <unk> Sonic , who aims to halt &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s plans by <unk> his animal friends and <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; himself .
If the player <unk> all the Chaos &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> the game , a <unk> ending sequence is shown .
If all the &lt; unk &gt; are not collected , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> the player while &lt; unk &gt; the Chaos &lt; unk &gt; instead .
= = <unk> = = Sonic the Hedgehog is a <unk> , side @ - @ <unk> <unk> , whose gameplay centers around Sonic &apos; s ability to run at high speed through levels <unk> <unk> , slopes , high falls , and loop @ - @ the @ - @ <unk> .
The levels contain &lt; unk &gt; in the form of <unk> ( &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; in the Western game <unk> ) inside of which Dr. &lt; unk &gt; has trapped animals .
Although destroying a <unk> <unk> the animal within , this is not required to complete the game .
The player must avoid <unk> of sharp spikes , falling into &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , being <unk> by moving walls or platforms , and <unk> ( which can be <unk> by <unk> air <unk> <unk> released from &lt; unk &gt; ) .
Sonic &apos; s main attack is his spin , where he &lt; unk &gt; into a ball and &lt; unk &gt; rapidly ( damaging enemies and some <unk> ) .
This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground .
&lt; unk &gt; around each level map are <unk> rings , and <unk> 100 rings <unk> the player with an extra life .
&lt; unk &gt; are a layer of protection against &lt; unk &gt; ; if Sonic has at least one ring when he &lt; unk &gt; with an enemy ( or <unk> ) , he will survive .
However , all his rings will be scattered ; they will &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> in a few seconds if they are not <unk> up again .
If Sonic is hit without any rings , he <unk> a life .
Although <unk> and temporary &lt; unk &gt; may be collected to provide additional protection , certain &lt; unk &gt; ( such as <unk> , being <unk> , falling down a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> or running out of time ) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection .
The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill , &lt; unk &gt; , Spring <unk> , <unk> , Star Light , and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> ) , each with its own <unk> style and enemies .
A player must <unk> through each zone ( <unk> into three acts ) to progress .
At the end of each zone &apos; s third act , the player <unk> Dr. &lt; unk &gt; ( who <unk> a different <unk> each time ) in a boss fight .
After the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the <unk> Zone for a last encounter with &lt; unk &gt; .
The player begins with three lives ( power @ - @ <unk> and rings add more ) , which are lost when Sonic &lt; unk &gt; with <unk> enemies ( or objects ) without rings , falls off @ - @ screen or <unk> an act &apos; s ten @ - @ minute time limit .
&lt; unk &gt; acting as <unk> allow Sonic to return to the most @ - @ recently <unk> post when he <unk> a life .
If he <unk> a life as a result of time running out but has another life , the &lt; unk &gt; will <unk> to 0 : 00 when he returns to the &lt; unk &gt; .
If all lives are lost at any point in the game , the game over screen will appear ( when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives , if they have any continues ) .
When Sonic <unk> the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least <unk> rings , a large ring appears through which he can <unk> to enter a Special <unk> ( a &quot; Secret Zone &quot; in the original Genesis manual ) .
In each of six Special &lt; unk &gt; , Sonic &lt; unk &gt; off the &lt; unk &gt; and walls of a rotating <unk> in spin attack .
Although the player <unk> a continue with each 50 rings found , their main goal is to obtain the Chaos <unk> at the end of the <unk> without <unk> with a &quot; goal block &quot; ( which ends the level ) .
= = Development = = = = = Background and character design = = = In 1990 , Sega ordered its in @ - @ house development studio , &lt; unk &gt; , to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company .
This was a position already held by the character Alex &lt; unk &gt; , but he was considered similar to Mario and deemed <unk> ; Sega president &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; wanted a character as <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
Sega had competition from Nintendo and its mascot , Mario , in mind ; Nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. 3 , and Sega wanted a <unk> in the industry .
Although the company had some success with Genesis <unk> of its <unk> titles , it knew this would not be enough .
&lt; unk &gt; developed <unk> for characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics .
Development <unk> speed , so &lt; unk &gt; eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast <unk> like &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> .
One idea , a &lt; unk &gt; able to <unk> objects with <unk> <unk> , showed <unk> at first but was too complex for the available <unk> .
The team <unk> its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move .
&lt; unk &gt; then <unk> that this would not <unk> aggressive enough , so they focused on two animals with spikes : &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; character , first proposed by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , although the &lt; unk &gt; would later become the basis for <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; ( who first appeared in 1993 &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; the Hedgehog ) .
&lt; unk &gt; has admitted since that he created Sonic &apos; s basic design by <unk> <unk> the <unk> &apos; s head with <unk> <unk> &apos; s body .
Sonic was originally &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ <unk> , then a light <unk> of blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain <unk> and to match the Sega <unk> .
His <unk> were <unk> red through the <unk> of Michael Jackson &apos; s <unk> on the album cover for Bad and the <unk> of Santa <unk> , whom &lt; unk &gt; saw as the most &quot; famous character in the world &quot; .
Sonic &apos; s spikes were <unk> to make him look &lt; unk &gt; , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one <unk> ) .
The new character was originally named &quot; Mr. &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , but the eight @ - @ member &lt; unk &gt; changed his name to &quot; Sonic &quot; and their <unk> to Sonic Team .
&lt; unk &gt; proposed to <unk> out the character included placing him in a rock band , giving him <unk> <unk> , and giving him a human <unk> named Madonna , but Sega of America <unk> these <unk> to keep his identity simple .
Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a &lt; unk &gt; is and initially proposed a full @ - @ scale <unk> of the character , but <unk> with Sonic Team to simply make design changes .
The <unk> ended up being named &quot; Dr. &lt; unk &gt; &quot; in Japan and &quot; Dr. &lt; unk &gt; &quot; in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega &apos; s American and Japanese divisions .

&lt; unk &gt; originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War , but was &lt; unk &gt; in the project for nearly a year .
His designs for levels were intended to attract both <unk> and <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> set pieces into the mostly <unk> level design .
The game &apos; s color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and the <unk> of Green Hill were influenced by the <unk> of California .
In <unk> the game mechanics , &lt; unk &gt; was inspired by <unk> <unk> , whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier .
&lt; unk &gt; the <unk> of <unk> &apos; s mechanics in complex <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a <unk> <unk> for movement and a single <unk> for jumping .
He also wanted his creation to be more action @ - @ <unk> than the Mario series ; while playing Super Mario Bros. , he had <unk> why the levels could not be <unk> more quickly .
Due to the need to <unk> the Genesis &apos; <unk> <unk> , the developing game underwent extensive testing and <unk> , a process taking over six months .
The <unk> &apos; efforts were <unk> ; according to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , the game had the fastest @ - @ ever character speed in a video game and a <unk> effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console .
The team intended to add a two @ - @ player <unk> displayed via split @ - @ screen , but &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s programming knowledge was <unk> to <unk> this feature .
However , such a <unk> would later appear in sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ( 1992 ) , where the second player would control Sonic &apos; s best friend <unk> &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months .
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s relationship with Sega of Japan was <unk> during this time ; he received little credit for his involvement in the game .

They wanted to find a <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> content , and studied <unk> <unk> such as Law and Order and &lt; unk &gt; : <unk> <unk> Investigation for <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; explained , &quot; While we make sure that our episodes are self @ - @ contained – have a beginning , a middle , and an end – the character <unk> can be <unk> .
They don &apos; t have to <unk> themselves over the course of one show . &quot;
&quot; The Same Old Story &quot; was Fringe &apos; s first regular episode , and some <unk> viewed it as an example of how the series would be <unk> .
The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much <unk> among the series &apos; different <unk> .

Despite these <unk> , Jackson said he would <unk> in next week because he would &quot; rather have a show &lt; unk &gt; on the side of <unk> than <unk> , and I &apos; m interested to see if <unk> has any more <unk> up his <unk> &quot; .

A <unk> <unk> <unk> was concerned that the <unk> pilot would be hard to <unk> into <unk> episodes , but &quot; after <unk> down to watch Fringe &apos; s second episode , &quot; The Same Old Story &quot; , my concerns have <unk> .
Fringe &apos; s second episode <unk> all that is <unk> about <unk> programming without &lt; unk &gt; any of Fringe &apos; s <unk> @ - @ <unk> and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> <unk> of what makes Fringe not X @ - @ <unk> is even better defined in the first <unk> @ - @ episode .
I &apos; d struggled to find the word to <unk> it , and the <unk> is &apos; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; . &quot;
The Same Old Story &quot; has all of the sense of <unk> , <unk> , and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller , more &lt; unk &gt; space . &quot;
Another <unk> writer , Alex &lt; unk &gt; , later compared &quot; The Same Old Story &quot; to the similarly @ - @ <unk> The X @ - @ <unk> episode &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .

= U.S. Route 2 in Michigan = US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) is a component of the United States &lt; unk &gt; Highway System that connects <unk> , Washington , to the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan , with a separate segment that runs from &lt; unk &gt; Point , New York , to &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> .
In Michigan , the highway runs through the UP in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at &lt; unk &gt; and ending at St. Ignace ; in between , US 2 briefly <unk> the state of Wisconsin .
As one of the major transportation &lt; unk &gt; in the UP , US 2 is a major <unk> for traffic through the state and <unk> northern <unk> states .
Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle &lt; unk &gt; , and other segments are listed as state @ - @ designated <unk> Michigan &lt; unk &gt; .
There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US 2 that date to the &lt; unk &gt; and 1920s .
The highway runs through rural sections of the UP , passing through two national and two state forests in the process .
The route of what became US 2 was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the UP , and as part of the Michigan segments of the <unk> <unk> International Highway and the King &apos; s International Highway auto trails in the early 20th century .
The state later included these trails as part of M ‑ 12 when the first state highway &lt; unk &gt; were designated in 1919 .
Most of M ‑ 12 was <unk> as part of US 2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 .
Since the 1930s , several changes have &lt; unk &gt; the highway &apos; s routing through the UP .
One such <unk> eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with <unk> , Wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of US 2 closer to the Lake Michigan <unk> .
With the creation of the Interstate Highway System , part of US 2 was rerouted to <unk> with the new Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) , though in the 1980s , the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I ‑ 75 freeway , resulting in today &apos; s basic form .
= = Route description = = According to a 2006 regional planning committee report , US 2 is a key highway for Michigan , providing its main western <unk> .
The roadway plays &quot; an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern <unk> of states in the <unk> &quot; , and is listed on the National Highway System ( <unk> ) for its entire length .
The <unk> is a network of roadways important to the country &apos; s economy , defense , and mobility .

The highway crosses the river into &lt; unk &gt; County and passes a <unk> center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown .
<unk> along &lt; unk &gt; Drive , US 2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas <unk> .
The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown &lt; unk &gt; and crossed the border into <unk> and back to the main highway .
The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the <unk> on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line .
US 2 continues eastward through UP <unk> to the city of &lt; unk &gt; .
While bypassing the community of <unk> , the highway crosses a branch of the Black River .
The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake , meeting M ‑ 28 at a &lt; unk &gt; in town .
As the US Highway leaves Wakefield , it turns <unk> through the <unk> National Forest , crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> River .
US 2 and M ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in the community of &lt; unk &gt; .
This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) recorded a daily average usage along the <unk> of <unk> vehicles , compared to the overall average of 5 @ , @ <unk> vehicles for the highway .
At the end of the concurrency , M ‑ 64 turns <unk> to run along Lake &lt; unk &gt; .
The highway continues parallel to the state line from the &lt; unk &gt; area through the national forest toward &lt; unk &gt; .
That <unk> community is the home of the &lt; unk &gt; High School &lt; unk &gt; , the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN <unk> and a documentary series on the <unk> Channel .
The area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills <unk> to Lake Superior via the &lt; unk &gt; River , to Lake Michigan via the &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; rivers , or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers .

The trunkline runs along the main street of Norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus of US 8 .
Then US 2 continues east through rural <unk> County to <unk> , passing north of &lt; unk &gt; Lake through the &lt; unk &gt; Country State Forest , before crossing the <unk> River in &lt; unk &gt; and passing into &lt; unk &gt; County .
In &lt; unk &gt; County , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2 .
The highway passes through the edge of the community of &lt; unk &gt; before entering <unk> .
US 2 comes to a three @ - @ way intersection and turns northeast <unk> onto US 41 .
The concurrent highway runs from <unk> through the <unk> of Wilson and &lt; unk &gt; on the south side of the &lt; unk &gt; Railway .
At Harris , the trunkline enters the &lt; unk &gt; Indian Community .
Harris is on the &lt; unk &gt; County side of the <unk> , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to &lt; unk &gt; River on the Delta County side .
The county line in between not only separates the two <unk> , but also serves as the <unk> between the Central and Eastern time zones .
East of &lt; unk &gt; River , the highway crosses the community &apos; s <unk> <unk> before <unk> the eastern terminus of M ‑ 69 .

The road turns inland again , and US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 passes to the west of downtown <unk> .
The highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no &lt; unk &gt; access .
Unlike a freeway , the expressway has <unk> intersections and not <unk> .
The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) and crosses the &lt; unk &gt; Railroad south of the &lt; unk &gt; for 4th Avenue North , where M ‑ 35 separates from the US Highways and turns to the northwest .
The expressway continues north parallel to the &lt; unk &gt; Railway , crossing the <unk> River .
Through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) for car traffic .
This is the only road in the UP with a speed limit higher than 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) <unk> I @ - @ 75 , which has a speed limit of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) .
The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de &lt; unk &gt; before ending at Rapid River .
In this location , US 41 separates to the north , and US 2 returns to an <unk> track as a two @ - @ lane road , crossing the Rapid and &lt; unk &gt; rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay .
As US 2 crosses southern Delta County , it passes through the western unit of the &lt; unk &gt; National Forest .

The road continues along the Lake Michigan <unk> , passing &lt; unk &gt; <unk> near &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and turning inland immediately west of St. Ignace .
The US 2 designation ends at the highway &apos; s <unk> cloverleaf interchange with I ‑ 75 .
The roadway continues <unk> into downtown St. Ignace as Business <unk> I ‑ 75 ( <unk> I ‑ 75 ) .
= = History = = = = = Indian trail through auto trails = = = In <unk> , the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes , rivers and Indian trails .
Two of these trails followed parts of the future US 2 .
The &lt; unk &gt; – Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan <unk> routing of US 2 between &lt; unk &gt; and St. Ignace .
The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Marie .
In the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names .
When the original roadways between &lt; unk &gt; and Iron River were completed in late 1915 , the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau ( &lt; unk &gt; ) named the area &lt; unk &gt; and the highway the &lt; unk &gt; Trail .
Later the name was extended over the highway to &lt; unk &gt; , and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s ; the name was <unk> out by the &lt; unk &gt; completely in 1927 .
The roadways were also used for the <unk> <unk> International Highway , named for former US president <unk> <unk> after his death in 1919 .
Overall , this highway ran from Portland , Oregon , to Portland , <unk> , by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario .
Through the UP , the southern branch followed the immediate <unk> to US 2 , including the section through Florence County , Wisconsin .
The Great Lakes <unk> Route was established in 1917 by the &lt; unk &gt; .
A <unk> of the Great Lakes Circle &lt; unk &gt; by <unk> years , the route followed &quot; a <unk> journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ... &quot; This route followed the modern US 2 from &lt; unk &gt; to the M ‑ 94 junction in &lt; unk &gt; , using the modern M ‑ 69 and M ‑ 95 to stay in Michigan .
&lt; unk &gt; of the route followed US 41 and M ‑ 35 between <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; .
The route was originally intended to <unk> <unk> to drive around Lake Michigan .
The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I.
One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well .
In 1920 , the King &apos; s International Highway linked Vancouver , British Columbia , to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior .
&lt; unk &gt; had to ship their cars by boat between &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Marie , Ontario , and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail .
The &lt; unk &gt; varied on the <unk> of the time , but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken on the <unk> @ - @ Canada Highway name .
= = = State trunkline = = = The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M ‑ 12 , a designation that was in use by July 1 , 1919 , between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Marie .
The first <unk> park in the country was created by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; near what is now US 2 near Iron River in 1919 – 20 , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside US 16 ( Grand River Avenue ) in 1929 south of &lt; unk &gt; .
When the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , US 2 partially replaced M @ - @ 12 .
Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain , US 2 was routed through Florence , Wisconsin .
The former routing of M ‑ 12 from Crystal Falls to &lt; unk &gt; became a new M ‑ 69 when the former M ‑ 69 became US <unk> ( now US 141 ) .
M ‑ 12 from &lt; unk &gt; south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M ‑ 45 , which is now M ‑ 95 .
By the next year , M ‑ 48 was added along US 2 from &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; as part of a larger extension .
The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a <unk> of downtown &lt; unk &gt; .
A larger &lt; unk &gt; was completed in 1933 between <unk> Park and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Marie .
The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to &lt; unk &gt; and north to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Marie ; the former routing was given the M ‑ <unk> designation .
Another <unk> in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the &lt; unk &gt; River between 1932 and 1934 .
Downtown &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated M ‑ 54 .
The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) changed the &lt; unk &gt; and designations of the highways around &lt; unk &gt; , Thompson and &lt; unk &gt; in the mid @ - @ 1930s .
The agency rerouted US 2 between &lt; unk &gt; and M ‑ <unk> in Thompson , turning the old road back to county control .
The section between M ‑ <unk> and M ‑ 125 was <unk> as an extension of M ‑ <unk> to Thompson , and M ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension of M ‑ <unk> .
The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on August 2 , 1936 .
The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time .
Between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , US 2 previously followed <unk> Road inland to the &lt; unk &gt; Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula .
The new routing took US 2 along the &lt; unk &gt; into St. Ignace .
US 31 was truncated to the state ferry <unk> in <unk> City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to <unk> Park ; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry <unk> became M ‑ <unk> .
Further changes in the early <unk> &lt; unk &gt; the roadway out near &lt; unk &gt; and Crystal Falls .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern &lt; unk &gt; routing between Gould City and &lt; unk &gt; in 1941 .
The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to &lt; unk &gt; and then along the lake to &lt; unk &gt; .
The former route through &lt; unk &gt; was turned back to local control as far east as &lt; unk &gt; .
From there east , it was numbered just M ‑ 48 , removing US 2 from a concurrency .
Another former section into &lt; unk &gt; was added to <unk> M ‑ <unk> .
The new highway was &lt; unk &gt; around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction <unk> over steel shortages during World War II .
The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the <unk> .
M ‑ 28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at &lt; unk &gt; from its western terminus at Wakefield .
A similar extension was made from M ‑ 28 &apos; s eastern terminus to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Marie in 1948 .
The M ‑ 54 designation was <unk> as Business US 2 by 1945 .
The eastern M ‑ 28 extension was <unk> in 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 .
= = = Interstate era = = = With the coming of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan , the MSHD planned to <unk> the eastern section of US 2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and &lt; unk &gt; St. Marie .
In planning <unk> from 1947 , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the &lt; unk &gt; .
It was also included in the General <unk> of National System of Interstate Highways <unk> All <unk> <unk> at Urban <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in September 1955 , or Yellow <unk> after the cover color , that was released in 1955 as the federal government &lt; unk &gt; plans for the freeway system .
The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) .
The first section of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and M ‑ 123 north of St. Ignace .
The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1 , 1957 ; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected US 2 to the bridge .
In 1961 , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the Mackinac Bridge and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; sections .
At the time , the I ‑ 75 designation &lt; unk &gt; US 27 on the bridge , and US 2 was shifted to follow I ‑ 75 along the <unk> in the St. Ignace area .
The former routing of US 2 in downtown St. Ignace was <unk> <unk> I ‑ 75 .
More sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Marie as well as between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
The last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at M ‑ 123 to &lt; unk &gt; , and the section between &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Marie .
At this time , all of US 2 &apos; s former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail ( H @ - @ <unk> ) .
The Department of State Highways expanded US 2 / US 41 into an expressway between <unk> and Rapid River in 1971 .
The state built a new bridge over the &lt; unk &gt; River in 1983 , bypassing downtown .
MDOT <unk> of the former routing of US 2 into downtown in two ways .
The western half was initially an <unk> state highway until it was later transferred to local control .
An extension of M ‑ 94 replaced the remainder , including the &lt; unk &gt; Bridge , through downtown .
In that same year , the department truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I ‑ 75 freeway .
The last changes were made to US 2 &apos; s routing through Iron River in 1998 , bypassing the bridge that <unk> carried the highway over the river in town .
In 2011 , MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from 55 to 65 mph ( 89 to 105 km / h ) , although the speed limit for <unk> remains 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) .
= = Memorial designations and <unk> routes = = On July 1 , <unk> , the State Administrative Board named M ‑ 12 , the <unk> to US 2 in Michigan , the &lt; unk &gt; Highway to honor Frank P. &lt; unk &gt; , a prominent local <unk> who later served in Congress from 1927 to 1933 .
In 1929 , the residents of &lt; unk &gt; created a memorial to the <unk> of World War I called <unk> <unk> .
The project consisted of &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> trees <unk> along US 2 / US 41 west of town .
The American <unk> sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers .
Later in 1949 , the &lt; unk &gt; Women &apos; s Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area <unk> .
Also called <unk> <unk> , the group <unk> 140 &lt; unk &gt; and 1 @ , @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , trees and <unk> as a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> along 2 @ .

Most of US 2 , along with US 23 in the Lower Peninsula , was designated the United Spanish War <unk> Memorial Highway in 1949 .
To <unk> the gap in the routing where US 2 <unk> through Wisconsin , M ‑ 95 and M ‑ 69 were used in place of US 2 between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls .
<unk> <unk> the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor George W. <unk> had them installed .
The &lt; unk &gt; Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 between the northern &lt; unk &gt; city limits and County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) in Delta County .
The American <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) organization in Michigan <unk> the Michigan <unk> to <unk> this designation , which was assigned under Public Act <unk> in 1959 .
Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour ( &lt; unk &gt; ) : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near &lt; unk &gt; to the M ‑ 28 junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , and the segment from the southern M ‑ 35 junction in &lt; unk &gt; to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
These two <unk> were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its <unk> in Wisconsin , <unk> and Ontario .
The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County <unk> Trail .
This <unk> Michigan Byway was designated to honor the &quot; rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and <unk> . &quot;
On August 26 , 2007 , MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that runs concurrently with M ‑ 35 in Delta County was being included in the UP &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> <unk> Trail .

In December 2012 , the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the &lt; unk &gt; River northwest of Iron Mountain .
The structure is a single @ - @ span , pin @ - @ connected , &lt; unk &gt; , through @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan .
It was built between <unk> and 1910 because the Twin Falls <unk> <unk> would flood an existing river crossing .
The span cost $ 5 @ , @ 106 ( equivalent to $ <unk> @ , @ 000 in 2015 ) , paid equally by <unk> and Florence counties .
Until the 1930s , the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the &lt; unk &gt; River .
In 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile <unk> , and the highway was rerouted over the new span .
The bridge closed to <unk> traffic in September 1971 , and the nomination process for <unk> on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012 .
In 2003 , MDOT replaced the <unk> River Bridge in &lt; unk &gt; Township , <unk> County .
As of October 2011 , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list .
It was built in 1929 .

The &lt; unk &gt; is located at &lt; unk &gt; , Suffolk , England .
It was built in the early nineteenth century to <unk> <unk> into flour .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; worked by wind power until <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; on two sails , after which it became &lt; unk &gt; .
In 1979 , a group of <unk> purchased &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; for restoration .
Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight @ - @ year period .
The mill is open to the public , and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site .
The mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and &lt; unk &gt; by a &lt; unk &gt; .
It <unk> two pairs of &lt; unk &gt; , with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine .
= = History = = The &lt; unk &gt; at &lt; unk &gt; was built by &lt; unk &gt; George &lt; unk &gt; for William Button in 1819 .
It replaced a post mill which had been moved to <unk> <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , Norfolk the previous year .
The mill was set to work on Christmas Day 1819 .
In <unk> , the mill was <unk> by the fitting of a cast @ - @ iron &lt; unk &gt; , Patent sails and a &lt; unk &gt; .
The new &lt; unk &gt; was fitted on 16 July <unk> .
It was made by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , the <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , and <unk> 1 &lt; unk &gt; tons ( 1 @ , @ <unk> kg ) .
A new stock was fitted in September <unk> .
William Button died on 11 February 1837 .
The mill passed <unk> to his <unk> <unk> and their son Richard .
Richard Button worked the mill until 1860 , at which date it was <unk> to his sons Richard and William , who sold it to Richard &lt; unk &gt; from &lt; unk &gt; , Norfolk in <unk> .
The mill was worked by Stephen &lt; unk &gt; , Richard &apos; s son .
He <unk> the mill on the death of his father in <unk> and <unk> it to Henry Bryant in <unk> .
In 1884 , the mill was sold by <unk> , and Henry Bryant purchased the &lt; unk &gt; .
Bryant rebuilt the <unk> of the mill .
From <unk> , a <unk> steam engine was used as auxiliary power , driving an extra pair of &lt; unk &gt; on the ground floor .
This was replaced in 1914 by a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> engine .
Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to &lt; unk &gt; Vincent , a retired &lt; unk &gt; from &lt; unk &gt; , Norfolk .
The &lt; unk &gt; engine was sold in the early 1920s .
The mill was &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , and as a result one pair of sails was removed .
Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in <unk> .
One of the remaining two sails was <unk> in 1926 when the mill was again &lt; unk &gt; .
On the death of &lt; unk &gt; Vincent in 1932 , his son George <unk> the property .
He lived at the site in an old &lt; unk &gt; until his death in 1973 .
The mill passed to his daughter , who sold it in 1974 to Mr and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , who intended to <unk> it into a house .
They later changed their <unk> and offered it for sale for restoration .
In 1976 , the cap of the mill was <unk> to pieces in a <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was purchased by five members of the Suffolk <unk> Group in November 1979 , and plans for restoration were made .
The <unk> consisted of Mark &lt; unk &gt; , Charles &lt; unk &gt; , Peter &lt; unk &gt; , David &lt; unk &gt; and Chris &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; mill and an acre of land cost £ 6 @ , @ 000 .

Much of the work was carried out by <unk> who used working <unk> to repair the mill .
= = = 1979 – 1980 = = = The <unk> took possession of the mill in November 1979 .
The first <unk> was to make the mill as &lt; unk &gt; as possible .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water <unk> of the structure .
The mill was <unk> and recorded .
In spring 1980 , the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; was erected to allow the &lt; unk &gt; to be dismantled , and the cap <unk> <unk> were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame .
A two @ - @ week work @ - @ in was held at the end of July and beginning of August 1980 .
<unk> @ - @ three volunteers worked on the mill over the work @ - @ in .
Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from &lt; unk &gt; of pitch pine which had previously been in a &lt; unk &gt; at <unk> St &lt; unk &gt; .
On 3 August 1980 , the &lt; unk &gt; and remaining sail <unk> were removed by a mobile crane , followed by the cap frame and the cast @ - @ iron curb sections .
New oak &lt; unk &gt; were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower .
The bin floor was removed , apart from one oak main beam which was &lt; unk &gt; .
A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine , and the oak beam was repaired .
New oak &lt; unk &gt; were fitted , along with some <unk> from the original floor which were fit to be <unk> .
One of these had previously been a <unk> from a Common sail .
Some of the &lt; unk &gt; were made from pitch pine from the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , which , following its collapse on 19 February 1977 , had been re @ - @ erected at the Museum of East <unk> Life , &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; <unk> was dismantled to <unk> its repair , brickwork was repaired , and new &lt; unk &gt; were made for some of the windows .
A &lt; unk &gt; was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter .
The &lt; unk &gt; on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of &lt; unk &gt; was removed .
The work was <unk> by grants of £ 500 from the Council for the Preservation of <unk> <unk> , £ 250 from St &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Council , £ 200 from the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and £ 200 from the Suffolk <unk> Group .
Other <unk> and income <unk> to £ 65 , with the <unk> of <unk> being met <unk> by the five owners .

= = = 1981 = = = In the 1981 season two separate work @ - @ ins were held , the first from 25 July to 2 August and the second from 22 August to 30 August .
A total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks .
The &lt; unk &gt; were removed from the stone floor , which was then repaired .
One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by Death <unk> <unk> , and over a third of the &lt; unk &gt; beam was replaced with oak .
The six <unk> for the &lt; unk &gt; frame were repaired one at a time , as they <unk> the whole of the <unk> of the machinery above .
One post required replacement .
It had &lt; unk &gt; and the floor had <unk> by 4 inches ( 100 mm ) causing the second main floor beam to <unk> .
When this work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor beam , which was removed in one piece so that the most <unk> route to <unk> its replacement could be <unk> .
The new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was &lt; unk &gt; .
The stone floor was <unk> , <unk> the old stone <unk> and those &lt; unk &gt; that were fit for <unk> .
Other &lt; unk &gt; were made new from oak or pitch pine .
New &lt; unk &gt; were laid in the dust floor , the 1 1 <unk> 4 inches ( 32 mm ) thick &lt; unk &gt; <unk> being double @ - @ <unk> with a metal <unk> between them .
<unk> on the bin floor are of a similar <unk> .
The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on <unk> them , <unk> by a &lt; unk &gt; attached to the upright shaft .
During the second work @ - @ in , the remainder of the stone floor was <unk> , again using double @ - @ <unk> <unk> with a metal <unk> between them .
The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the <unk> of the top four courses of brickwork continued .
The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering <unk> .
The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete &lt; unk &gt; cast as the tower was weak at this point and had <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; , the curb segments and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; were given two <unk> of red lead paint .
A new &lt; unk &gt; for the cap was made from a piece of oak 3 feet ( 910 mm ) long by 16 inches ( <unk> mm ) diameter .
A start was made on removing the old <unk> on the brickwork and &lt; unk &gt; with &lt; unk &gt; mortar .
After the work @ - @ in had finished , the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill <unk> <unk> in preparation for an open day which was held in late <unk> .
The work done in 1981 cost £ 3 @ , @ 250 .
&lt; unk &gt; received were £ 2 @ , @ 000 from &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , £ 1 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; from the Historic <unk> Council and £ 130 from St &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Council .

= = = 1982 = = = The 1982 work @ - @ ins took place from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August .
The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower , <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; curb , a start on the construction of the new cap , <unk> machinery and making and fitting various <unk> and windows .
The cap frame was constructed , <unk> two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be <unk> .
The cap frame was completed in <unk> 1982 .
It had been constructed <unk> down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the &lt; unk &gt; into position .
= = = 1983 = = = <unk> in the early part of 1983 was mainly <unk> to smaller jobs such as casting various &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> of the various parts of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails .
The mill was generally made as <unk> as possible inside in preparation for scheduled <unk> , including one from the <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of the Society for the Protection of Ancient <unk> .
Other work included the <unk> of the final drive to the 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 @ .
@ 40 m ) stones , including &lt; unk &gt; the stone <unk> and replacement of three &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> .
When the weather improved , work commenced outside .
The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work @ - @ in commenced .
The work @ - @ ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August , with 35 people <unk> .
During the first work @ - @ in , the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; were fitted .
The oak cap <unk> , which had been <unk> &lt; unk &gt; were fitted and the &lt; unk &gt; was supported by <unk> ready for final fitting .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; of oak were fitted and the &lt; unk &gt; was pulled into position using a &lt; unk &gt; .
The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; .
The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time .
Between the two work @ - @ ins , the rear &lt; unk &gt; was completed and the fitting of &lt; unk &gt; to the cap frame completed .
This <unk> a start to be made on boarding the cap on the <unk> of the second work @ - @ in .
The <unk> for the cap are <unk> inch ( 13 mm ) thick and 9 inches ( <unk> mm ) wide at the &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; towards the top .
A new <unk> bearing was installed under the &lt; unk &gt; , not without difficulty and much &lt; unk &gt; before it would fit .
When the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover <unk> were fitted over the <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; was drawn into position using a <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; , and the &lt; unk &gt; steel <unk> band &lt; unk &gt; into position , producing a &lt; unk &gt; structure .
The striking <unk> was fitted through the &lt; unk &gt; and the <unk> for the &lt; unk &gt; fitted in position on top of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
At the top of the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track <unk> &lt; unk &gt; into position .
&lt; unk &gt; of the brickwork of the tower continued , with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work @ - @ in .
After the work @ - @ ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for <unk> @ - @ on in October .
The weather <unk> the work initially , but the <unk> of a modern &lt; unk &gt; paint , designed to <unk> normal movement of the timber and yet remain &lt; unk &gt; , was completed in time for the <unk> @ - @ on .
A <unk> work @ - @ in was held the weekend before the cap was <unk> , with 17 people <unk> over the weekend .
<unk> work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill .
The &lt; unk &gt; was removed and the &lt; unk &gt; dismantled .
The 5 @ - @ <unk> cap was <unk> into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983 , watched by a crowd of some 70 people .
The fitting of the cap was &lt; unk &gt; with <unk> from &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; .
Restoration work in 1983 cost £ 1 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; .

Further income came from the sale of <unk> books and a drawing of the mill by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
= = = 1984 = = = Four work @ - @ ins were held during 1984 .
The first two were by &lt; unk &gt; from Eastern <unk> Board .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was chosen at the project to <unk> from the Young <unk> &apos; s Development Project for that year .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; had previously <unk> from the project , and its owners , the Suffolk Preservation <unk> , had suggested that &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; would be a good candidate for the scheme .
Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill .
A &lt; unk &gt; <unk> supply was provided .
An <unk> <unk> was laid with assistance from British <unk> who were &lt; unk &gt; a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; which had been developed at their research facility at &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The <unk> &lt; unk &gt; laid 25 yards ( 23 m ) of &lt; unk &gt; through which the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> was pulled into position .
The mill was then <unk> with <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; on each floor .
Other work undertaken by the &lt; unk &gt; involved <unk> some &lt; unk &gt; damage to the <unk> brickwork , <unk> a <unk> <unk> around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position .
A concrete path around the tower was <unk> <unk> , leading to rising &lt; unk &gt; .
A French <unk> was constructed around the mill to <unk> these <unk> .
A 21 <unk> ( 16 <unk> ) &lt; unk &gt; &amp; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane .
After fitting it was then painted .
Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary .
Off @ - @ site , the new brake wheel and &lt; unk &gt; were made .
The original brake wheel was too <unk> to repair , and showed evidence that it had been <unk> from the original one installed in 1819 .
The original brake wheel was 6 feet ( 1 @ .
@ 83 m ) diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their &lt; unk &gt; speed .
When the mill was <unk> in <unk> it was necessary to <unk> the <unk> <unk> within the mill , as Patent sails run at a <unk> speed than Common sails .
The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone <unk> reduced in diameter .
The brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original &lt; unk &gt; , resulting in a wheel 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @ .
@ 18 m ) in diameter .
The opinion of professional &lt; unk &gt; was sought , and it was decided that a <unk> @ - @ up version of the original brake wheel would be made , but <unk> the cast iron <unk> segments .
The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill .
The original iron segments were all broken , so a <unk> was made and new segments were cast in heat @ - @ treated <unk> cast iron .
When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; was made .
Some of the small &lt; unk &gt; were replaced .
The stocks were made from pitch pine and the &lt; unk &gt; from Douglas fir .
<unk> at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only one window still <unk> attention when the first work @ - @ in began .
New <unk> &lt; unk &gt; were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its <unk> position on the upright shaft .
The stocks and sails were made during the two work @ - @ ins held in July and August , a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks .
A second @ - @ hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and <unk> at the mill , but upon <unk> it was found to be <unk> for use .
<unk> two new stocks were required instead of one .
Modern steel stocks had already been <unk> on cost and &lt; unk &gt; grounds , leaving two <unk> .
<unk> stocks made from a single piece of timber , or &lt; unk &gt; stocks .
Good quality pitch pine was not &lt; unk &gt; in the lengths required .
Douglas fir was &lt; unk &gt; in such lengths but was <unk> on strength and &lt; unk &gt; grounds .
A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had &lt; unk &gt; after only seven years .
<unk> it was decided that &lt; unk &gt; stocks would be made .
The 52 feet ( 15 @ .
@ 85 m ) long stocks were made from Douglas fir .
All timber had been pressure treated with &lt; unk &gt; and well &lt; unk &gt; .
It was estimated that a &lt; unk &gt; stock would be up to 20 % stronger than a similar stock of solid timber .
The timber used was 1 1 <unk> 2 inches ( 38 mm ) thick and nine &lt; unk &gt; were required at the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end of the &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; attention was paid to where individual <unk> occurred between different pieces of timber .
Both stocks were made during the work @ - @ in , with one of them being <unk> and finished ready for use .
The stocks were the first &lt; unk &gt; stocks made by <unk> .
The four sails were made .
The <unk> being slightly different pairs .
<unk> on the inner stock having <unk> of 3 feet ( 910 mm ) pitch and those on the outer stock having <unk> of 3 feet 2 inches ( <unk> mm ) pitch .
It was decided that the new sails would be <unk> , at the larger pitch .
Four 27 feet ( 8 @ .
@ 23 m ) long &lt; unk &gt; were cut from a &lt; unk &gt; of pitch pine obtained from a demolished &lt; unk &gt; at <unk> St &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; are 6 inches ( 150 mm ) square at their inner end .
&lt; unk &gt; bars and &lt; unk &gt; were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality .
The &lt; unk &gt; for the sail bars were cut .
That at the <unk> of the sail being at 27 ° and that at the tip being 15 ° , <unk> by 1 <unk> ° at each sail bar .
Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in .
The &lt; unk &gt; and associated &lt; unk &gt; was fitted to the mill .
At the end of the second work @ - @ in , the cap could be turned by means of the hand &lt; unk &gt; .
The &lt; unk &gt; itself , with the &lt; unk &gt; painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards .
The &lt; unk &gt; arm brake wheel was assembled around the &lt; unk &gt; .
It was found that the &lt; unk &gt; was <unk> on the upright shaft by <unk> inch ( 13 mm ) .
When this was <unk> the brake wheel was within 1 / 16 &lt; unk &gt; of an inch ( less than 1 mm ) of true .
The &lt; unk &gt; for the stocks were &lt; unk &gt; from a &lt; unk &gt; of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year .
Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor <unk> , <unk> and painting &lt; unk &gt; and further &lt; unk &gt; on the brickwork .
The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work @ - @ in .
The stock , with one sail attached was <unk> <unk> through the poll end of the &lt; unk &gt; and when &lt; unk &gt; in position and the &lt; unk &gt; had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock .
The process was repeated for the second pair of sails .
The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work @ - @ in .
<unk> later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail , <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> out &lt; unk &gt; <unk> with the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The brake and brake <unk> were made and installed and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; for the sails were cast .
Restoration work in 1984 cost £ 2 @ , @ <unk> .
<unk> received were £ 1 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; from English <unk> , £ 500 from St &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Council , Other <unk> <unk> to £ 52 .
&lt; unk &gt; from open days at the mill came to £ <unk> .
A boost to the funds was £ 2 @ , @ 000 from &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
This money had been <unk> to allow the moving of a &lt; unk &gt; post mill <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; .
In the end , the removal was not proceeded with , and Mr &lt; unk &gt; allowed the donation to remain with the &lt; unk &gt; Mill Preservation <unk> .

The episode received positive reviews , while various members of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; crew consider the episode to be one of their <unk> , mainly due to the <unk> nature of the episode .

Series <unk> Stephen &lt; unk &gt; has described the episode plot as &quot; a classic thing all <unk> go through . &quot;
Much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers &apos; own experiences from childhood .
The episode originally aired on &lt; unk &gt; in the United States on September 21 , 2001 .
The episode marks the introduction of Mr. &lt; unk &gt; &apos; mother , Mama &lt; unk &gt; , who was <unk> by former &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> producer and current executive producer Paul &lt; unk &gt; .
The writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as <unk> to come up with much of the story lines for this episode .
The idea for &quot; &lt; unk &gt; Mouth &quot; was inspired by <unk> director <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s experience &quot; &#91; when &#93; I got in trouble for saying the <unk> @ - @ word in front of my mother . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; said , &quot; The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. &lt; unk &gt; to &lt; unk &gt; , with &lt; unk &gt; <unk> him , is <unk> much how it happened in real life . &quot;
The end of the episode , where Mr. &lt; unk &gt; uses more &lt; unk &gt; than &lt; unk &gt; and Patrick , was also inspired &quot; by the fact that my &#91; &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &#93; mother has a <unk> mouth herself . &quot;
The scene where &lt; unk &gt; and Patrick playing a game of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , which is a <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , was difficult for the crew to &lt; unk &gt; , since many shots featured certain board pieces <unk> location .
According to the series &apos; season 2 DVD commentary , it was planned to have a scene that had &lt; unk &gt; saying &quot; <unk> &apos; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &apos; <unk> &quot; followed by Patrick saying &quot; &apos; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> &apos; you too ! &quot;

The episode originally aired during the 2001 – 02 television season , <unk> the season in which the <unk> named &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; among the best programs on <unk> television , but the report cited a <unk> broadcast of the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of &lt; unk &gt; among children .
In a later report , several members of the <unk> listed &quot; &lt; unk &gt; Mouth &quot; as an example of how levels of &lt; unk &gt; , sexual , and violent activity has increased in children &apos; s television programming .

Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant <unk> on Australian society and national identity , including the Anzac spirit .
The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and its unique security <unk> .
As British &lt; unk &gt; , the Australian colonies participated in Britain &apos; s small wars of the 19th century , while later as a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and then an independent nation , Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War , as well as in the wars in Korea , Malaya , Borneo and Vietnam during the <unk> War .

War and military service have been <unk> <unk> in Australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of the Australian experience of war and of &lt; unk &gt; , known as the Anzac spirit .
These <unk> include <unk> of endurance , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; ; <unk> which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War .
The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in <unk> a sense of national identity .
The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture : &lt; unk &gt; with a powerful ally and <unk> warfare .
Indeed , Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942 , while since then an <unk> with the United States has &lt; unk &gt; its security .
&lt; unk &gt; , this <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; — both for cultural reasons such as shared values and <unk> , as well as for more &lt; unk &gt; security concerns — has <unk> that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies .
Regardless , a <unk> towards strategic &lt; unk &gt; has also been <unk> , with Australians often <unk> to think about defence issues or to &lt; unk &gt; resources until a crisis <unk> ; a <unk> which has <unk> resulted in &lt; unk &gt; for major military <unk> .
<unk> both the <unk> and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of international relations and the <unk> of national interests , a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious .
Such themes include : an <unk> of the state as the key actor in international politics , the &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , a <unk> in the enduring <unk> and <unk> of armed force as a &lt; unk &gt; of security , and the <unk> that the status &lt; unk &gt; in international <unk> should only be changed <unk> .

These &lt; unk &gt; are also <unk> of its unique security <unk> as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia @ - @ Pacific , and the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of a middle power <unk> removed from the centres of world power .
To be sure , during <unk> to the core Australia has often found itself defending the <unk> and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars .
Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers — known <unk> as &lt; unk &gt; — have often been noted , somewhat &lt; unk &gt; , for both their fighting <unk> and their <unk> <unk> .
= = Colonial era = = = = = British Forces in Australia , <unk> – 1870 = = = From <unk> until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces .
Originally Marines protected the early <unk> at Sydney <unk> and Norfolk Island , however they were relieved of these duties in <unk> by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the New South Wales Corps .
The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a <unk> of Irish <unk> at <unk> Hill in <unk> .
<unk> however <unk> in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more <unk> garrison in New South Wales and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s Land .
Chief of these <unk> was the <unk> Rebellion , a <unk> mounted by its officers in <unk> .
As a result , in January <unk> the <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) Regiment of <unk> arrived in Australia .
By 1870 , 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units .
Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever &lt; unk &gt; .
The British Army was instead used in <unk> , <unk> <unk> at <unk> institutions , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , putting down <unk> <unk> — as occurred at <unk> in <unk> — and to <unk> Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement .
<unk> British soldiers were involved in the battle at the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> on the Victorian &lt; unk &gt; .

During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by <unk> Royal Navy units of the East Indies Station , based in Sydney .
However , in <unk> Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been <unk> stationed in Australia .
The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913 , when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy ; the Royal Navy &apos; s <unk> , <unk> and structures were given to the Australian people .
= = = <unk> warfare , <unk> – 1934 = = = The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the <unk> arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied , but were <unk> hostile when the <unk> &apos; s presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants &apos; lands .
European <unk> <unk> Aboriginal populations , and the occupation or <unk> of lands and food resources sometimes led to <unk> .
By and large neither the British nor the &lt; unk &gt; approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than <unk> warfare .
At times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units .
Not all Aboriginal groups <unk> white <unk> on their lands , while many &lt; unk &gt; served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes .
Fighting between &lt; unk &gt; and Europeans was <unk> as the &lt; unk &gt; did not form &lt; unk &gt; capable of sustained resistance .
As a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent <unk> and <unk> across the <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; or <unk> however , a <unk> of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century .
This warfare &lt; unk &gt; the popular and at times academic &quot; <unk> &quot; of <unk> settlement in Australia .
<unk> with Aboriginal resistance settlers often <unk> with violence , resulting in a number of <unk> <unk> .
Among the most famous is the Battle of &lt; unk &gt; in Western Australia in <unk> .
Such incidents were not officially <unk> however , and after the &lt; unk &gt; Creek massacre in New South Wales in <unk> seven Europeans were <unk> for their part in the <unk> .
However , in Tasmania the so @ - @ called Black War was fought between <unk> and <unk> , and aimed at driving most of the island &apos; s native inhabitants onto a number of isolated <unk> .
Although it began in failure for the British , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population .
It may be <unk> though to <unk> the conflict as one <unk> and mainly &lt; unk &gt; by Europeans on &lt; unk &gt; .
Although many more &lt; unk &gt; died than British , this may have had more to do with the <unk> and <unk> <unk> enjoyed by the Europeans .
Aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre @ - @ existing hunting and fighting practices — using &lt; unk &gt; , clubs and other <unk> weapons .
Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America , on the main &lt; unk &gt; failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans .
Although there were some <unk> of individuals and groups <unk> and using firearms , this was not widespread .
The &lt; unk &gt; were never a serious military threat to European settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have <unk> them .
On occasions large groups of &lt; unk &gt; attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the &lt; unk &gt; would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage .
This could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in <unk> formation in an attempt to <unk> and <unk> their opponents , waiting out the first <unk> of shots and then <unk> their &lt; unk &gt; while the settlers &lt; unk &gt; .
However , such open warfare usually proved more <unk> for the &lt; unk &gt; than the Europeans .
Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms .
However , the <unk> <unk> by firearms have often been &lt; unk &gt; .
Prior to the late 19th century , firearms were often &lt; unk &gt; muzzle @ - @ <unk> , <unk> @ - @ <unk> , single shot &lt; unk &gt; with <unk> @ - @ <unk> <unk> .
Such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only <unk> within 50 metres ( 160 ft ) .
These <unk> may have initially given the &lt; unk &gt; an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with &lt; unk &gt; or clubs .
Yet by <unk> significant <unk> in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage , with the six @ - @ shot &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , the &lt; unk &gt; single shot <unk> @ - @ <unk> rifle and later the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ Henry rifle , as well as rapid @ - @ fire rifles such as the <unk> rifle , becoming available .
These weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to <unk> and engage groups of &lt; unk &gt; , often proved successful .
The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast @ - @ moving , often hidden enemies .
<unk> employed included night @ - @ time surprise attacks , and <unk> forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks .
The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the <unk> of British settlement in Australia .
Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May <unk> , it continued in Sydney and its <unk> until the <unk> .
As the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into <unk> New South Wales in the <unk> .
In Tasmania , fighting can be <unk> from <unk> to the <unk> , while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the <unk> and <unk> .
The south @ - @ west of Western Australia experienced warfare from <unk> to <unk> .
The war in Queensland began in the area around Brisbane in the <unk> and continued until 1860 , moving to central Queensland in the <unk> and <unk> , and then to northern Queensland from the <unk> to 1900 .
In Western Australia , the violence moved north with European settlement , reaching the &lt; unk &gt; region by <unk> , with violent <unk> continuing until the 1920s .
In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central Australia , continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s .
One <unk> of casualties places European deaths at 2 @ , @ 500 , while at least 20 @ , @ 000 &lt; unk &gt; are believed to have <unk> .

= = = Colonial military forces , 1870 – 1901 = = = From 1870 until 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence .
The colonies had gained responsible government between <unk> and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some <unk> , the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia .
To do this , they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces .
<unk> these were <unk> in support of British <unk> , but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence <unk> .
The colonial military forces included <unk> volunteer militia , paid <unk> soldiers , and a small permanent component .
They were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither <unk> in barracks nor subject to full military <unk> .
Even after significant reforms in the <unk> — including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units — they remained too small and &lt; unk &gt; to be considered armies in the modern sense .
By 1885 , the forces numbered 21 @ , @ 000 men .
Although they could not be <unk> to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising &lt; unk &gt; to serve in Sudan , South Africa and China .
Despite a reputation of colonial &lt; unk &gt; , many of the <unk> raised units were highly organised , <unk> , professional , and well trained .
During this period , defences in Australia mainly <unk> around <unk> defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on <unk> coastal forts .
However , by the <unk> , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards — who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces — to the <unk> that the colonies could be defended by the rapid &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> of infantry .
As a consequence he called for a &lt; unk &gt; of defences , and defensive <unk> to be made between the colonies .
Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be &lt; unk &gt; and for professional units — <unk> to serve <unk> in the South Pacific — to replace the volunteer forces .
These views found support in the influential New South Wales <unk> , Major General Edward <unk> , however <unk> held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria &lt; unk &gt; the <unk> .
These reforms remaining <unk> however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political <unk> of the colonies .
With the <unk> of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies .
In <unk> , Victoria received its own naval vessel , &lt; unk &gt; Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First &lt; unk &gt; War marked the first occasion that an Australian <unk> had been deployed overseas .
The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @ - @ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @ - @ boats for the defence of <unk> and rivers , as well as naval <unk> to man vessels and forts .
Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @ - @ sail <unk> HMS Nelson on <unk> from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @ - @ boats .
New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in <unk> and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @ - @ boats and a &lt; unk &gt; .
The Queensland <unk> Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , <unk> <unk> .
Tasmania had also a small <unk> Corps , while Western Australia &apos; s only naval defences included the <unk> Naval <unk> .
Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; Rebellion in China in 1900 , while <unk> <unk> was sent by South Australia but saw no action .

In <unk> , as part of the &lt; unk &gt; War , the <unk> sent an army to deal with the <unk> , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of &lt; unk &gt; their forces .
The British instructed the <unk> to abandon the Sudan , and sent General Charles Gordon to co @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; the evacuation , but he was killed in January 1885 .
When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885 , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent &apos; s <unk> .
The New South Wales &lt; unk &gt; consisted of an infantry battalion of <unk> men and 24 officers , and an artillery battery of <unk> men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885 .
The contingent arrived in &lt; unk &gt; on 29 March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .

Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards &lt; unk &gt; , on the <unk> .
The Australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a <unk> corps was raised and 50 men volunteered .
They &lt; unk &gt; on a reconnaissance to &lt; unk &gt; on 6 May and were heavily involved in a &lt; unk &gt; during which more than 100 <unk> were killed or captured .
On 15 May , they made one last <unk> to <unk> the dead from the fighting of the previous March .
Meanwhile , the artillery were posted at &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> for a month , but they soon <unk> the camp at &lt; unk &gt; .
Eventually the British government decided that the campaign in Sudan was not <unk> the effort required and left a garrison in &lt; unk &gt; .
The New South Wales &lt; unk &gt; sailed for home on 17 May , arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885 .

After the outbreak of war , plans for the <unk> of a combined Australian force were subsequently set <unk> by the British War Office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate &lt; unk &gt; to serve with British <unk> , with two squadrons each of 125 men from New South Wales and Victoria , and one each from the other colonies .
The first troops arrived three weeks later , with the New South Wales &lt; unk &gt; — who had been training in England before the war , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> to South Africa .
On 22 November , the &lt; unk &gt; came under fire for the first time near &lt; unk &gt; , and they subsequently forced their <unk> to withdraw after <unk> significant casualties on them .
Following a series of minor victories , the British suffered a major <unk> during Black Week between 10 – 17 December 1899 , although no Australian units were involved .
The first &lt; unk &gt; of infantry from Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia , and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on 26 November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel John Charles &lt; unk &gt; .
With a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry .
Further units from Queensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front .
The first casualties occurred soon after at &lt; unk &gt; on 1 January 1900 , after 250 Queensland Mounted Infantry and a column of <unk> , British and artillery attacked a Boer &lt; unk &gt; at &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; David &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> Jones were killed when their patrol <unk> with the Boer forward &lt; unk &gt; .
Regardless , the &lt; unk &gt; were <unk> and during two hours of heavy fighting , more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner .
Five hundred &lt; unk &gt; and the New South Wales &lt; unk &gt; subsequently took part in the Siege of &lt; unk &gt; in February 1900 .
Despite serious set @ - @ backs at &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in January — and with &lt; unk &gt; still under siege — the British mounted a five division counter @ - @ invasion of the <unk> Free State in February .
The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales &lt; unk &gt; , Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army <unk> Corps attached .
First , &lt; unk &gt; was relieved following the battles of &lt; unk &gt; River and &lt; unk &gt; , and the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; defeated at &lt; unk &gt; , with the New South Wales Mounted <unk> locating the Boer general , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The British entered &lt; unk &gt; on 13 March 1900 , while &lt; unk &gt; was relieved .

Following the defeat of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> still the &lt; unk &gt; held out , forming small <unk> units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to <unk> British troop movements and lines of supply .
This new phase of resistance led to further <unk> in the Australian colonies and the raising of the &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with <unk> @ - @ <unk> and shooting <unk> , but little military experience .
After <unk> in 1901 , eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended .
Some Australians later joined local South African <unk> units , instead of returning home after <unk> .
These soldiers were part of the British Army , and were subject to British military <unk> .
Such units included the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; which gained <unk> as the unit in which Harry &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; &lt; unk &gt; and Peter &lt; unk &gt; served in before their court martial and <unk> for war crimes .

The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy <unk> causing 32 casualties .
During the night the defenders <unk> in , enduring <unk> and rifle fire .
A relief force was stopped by the &lt; unk &gt; , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved .
The siege lasted 11 days , during which more than 1 @ , @ 800 shells were fired into the post .
After calls to surrender were <unk> by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the &lt; unk &gt; eventually retired .
The Siege of &lt; unk &gt; River was one of the major <unk> of the Australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on 16 August .
In response the British adopted counter @ - @ <unk> tactics , including a &lt; unk &gt; <unk> policy involving the burning of houses and <unk> , the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children , and a system of &lt; unk &gt; and field <unk> to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications .
Such <unk> required considerable <unk> , and caused much <unk> towards the British , however they soon <unk> results .

In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to <unk> ships from the Australian Squadron to China .
The colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa , they had to <unk> on naval forces for manpower .
The force <unk> was a <unk> one , with Britain <unk> 200 men from Victoria , <unk> from New South Wales and the South Australian ship <unk> <unk> , under the command of Captain William &lt; unk &gt; .

Under the Constitution of Australia , defence responsibility was now <unk> in the new federal government .
The co @ - @ <unk> of Australia @ - @ wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind &lt; unk &gt; , and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result , while the Commonwealth Military Forces ( early <unk> of the Australian Army ) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established .
The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on 1 March 1901 and all the colonial forces — including those still in South Africa — became part of the new force .
28 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; colonial soldiers , including 1 @ , @ <unk> professional soldiers , 18 @ , @ <unk> paid militia and 8 @ , @ &lt; unk &gt; <unk> volunteers , were subsequently transferred .
The individual units continued to be <unk> under the various colonial <unk> until the Defence Act <unk> brought all the units under one piece of legislation .
This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and <unk> that militia forces could not be used in industrial <unk> or serve outside Australia .
However , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the <unk> Military Forces ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
Major General Sir Edward <unk> — a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces — subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on 26 December and set to work &lt; unk &gt; an integrated structure for the new army .
In 1911 , following a report by Lord &lt; unk &gt; the Royal Military College , &lt; unk &gt; was established , as was a system of <unk> National Service .
Prior to <unk> each self @ - @ <unk> colony had operated its own naval force .
These navies were small and lacked blue water <unk> , forcing the separate colonies to &lt; unk &gt; the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades .
The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901 , when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created .
This new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy .
In 1907 Prime Minister <unk> <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; , while attending the Imperial Conference in London , sought the British Government &apos; s agreement to end the <unk> system and develop an Australian navy .
The <unk> rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested &lt; unk &gt; that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be <unk> .

This visit fired public <unk> for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @ - @ <unk> River @ - @ class destroyers .
The <unk> in German naval construction prompted the <unk> to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911 , <unk> the Commonwealth Naval Force .
On 4 October 1913 , the new fleet <unk> through Sydney <unk> , consisting of the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; Australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction .
And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a <unk> force .
The Australian Flying Corps ( <unk> ) was established as part of the Commonwealth Military Forces in <unk> , prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the Royal Australian Air Force , making it the second oldest air force in the world .

This was itself in part due to the large number of British @ - @ born <unk> and first generation <unk> @ - @ Australians that made up the Australian population at the time .
Indeed , by the end of the war almost 20 % of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain .
As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the <unk> of the Defence Act <unk> , an all @ - @ volunteer <unk> force known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) was formed and <unk> began on 10 August 1914 .

Consequently , Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to <unk> during the war .
The war had a <unk> effect on Australian society in other ways also .
Indeed , for many Australians the nation &apos; s involvement is seen as a <unk> of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the <unk> of Australian character and &lt; unk &gt; that <unk> today have their <unk> in the war .
64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War .

Following the end of the First World War , the western powers — including Britain — <unk> , giving half @ - @ <unk> support to the pro @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; , anti @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; White Russian forces .
Although the Australian government refused to commit forces , many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting .
A small number served as <unk> to White Russian units with the North Russian <unk> Force ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> in England , about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia <unk> Force ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed .
The Royal Australian Navy destroyer &lt; unk &gt; <unk> was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late 1918 .
Other Australians served as <unk> with the British Military Mission to the White Russian General , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in South Russia , while several more advised Admiral &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> .
Later , they also served in <unk> as part of &lt; unk &gt; and the &lt; unk &gt; Mission , although these missions were aimed at <unk> Turkish access to the Middle East and India , and did little fighting .
Although the <unk> of those Australian &apos; s that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be <unk> at , it seems unlikely to have been political .
Regardless , they confirmed a reputation for &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> , winning the only two Victoria <unk> of the land campaign , despite their small numbers .
Yet Australian involvement was <unk> <unk> at home at the time and made little <unk> to the <unk> of the war .

The Australians were subsequently <unk> to the battalions of other &lt; unk &gt; , such as the British Battalion and the Lincoln Battalion , rather than forming their own units .
Most were <unk> motivated by <unk> reasons , while a number were Spanish @ - @ born <unk> who returned to fight in their country of origin .
At least 66 Australians volunteered , with only one — &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , a conservative &lt; unk &gt; who was later killed serving in the RAF during the Second World War — known to have fought for General Francisco <unk> &apos; s <unk> forces .
While a celebrated cause for the Australian left — particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade <unk> movement — the war failed to <unk> particular public interest and the government maintained its <unk> .
Australian opposition to the Republican cause was &lt; unk &gt; by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; on an anti @ - @ communist basis , rather than a pro @ - @ <unk> basis .
&lt; unk &gt; , although individual right wing Australians may have served with the <unk> <unk> , they received no public support .
Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time , however as the government received no reports of Australians <unk> to Spain to <unk> , no action was taken .
Consequently , returned <unk> were neither recognised by the government or the &lt; unk &gt; and Services League of Australia ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least 14 were killed .

At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and &lt; unk &gt; for war .

While there was no <unk> of volunteers like the First World War , a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid @ - @ 1940 .
Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940 , three of which were <unk> to the Middle East .
The RAAF &apos; s resources were initially mainly <unk> to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , through which almost 28 @ , @ 000 Australians were trained during the war .
The Australian military &apos; s first major <unk> of the war were against Italian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa .
During 1940 the light cruiser &lt; unk &gt; Sydney and five elderly destroyers ( <unk> the &quot; &lt; unk &gt; Iron <unk> &quot; by Nazi <unk> Minister Joseph <unk> — a title <unk> accepted by the ships ) took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet , and sank several Italian warships .
The Army first saw action in January 1941 , when the 6th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation &lt; unk &gt; .
The division assaulted and captured &lt; unk &gt; on 5 January and &lt; unk &gt; on 22 January , with <unk> of thousands of Italian troops <unk> at both <unk> .
The 6th Division took part in the <unk> of the Italian Army and captured &lt; unk &gt; on 4 February .
In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece , and was replaced by the 9th Division .
The Australian forces in the Mediterranean <unk> a number of campaigns during 1941 .
During April , the 6th Division , other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which <unk> attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece .
At the end of this campaign , the 6th Division was <unk> to Egypt and Crete .
The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May , which also ended in defeat for the Allies .
Over 5 @ , @ 000 Australians were captured in these campaigns , and the 6th Division required a long period of <unk> before it was again ready for combat .
The Germans and <unk> also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt .
The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were <unk> at &lt; unk &gt; ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October .
During June , the main body of the 7th Division , a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the <unk> @ - @ <unk> Campaign against the &lt; unk &gt; French .
Resistance was stronger than expected ; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French &lt; unk &gt; in early July .
The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early 1942 , after the outbreak of the Pacific War .
The 9th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East , and played a key role in the First Battle of El &lt; unk &gt; during June and the Second Battle of El &lt; unk &gt; in October .
The division returned to Australia in early 1943 , but several RAAF squadrons and &lt; unk &gt; warships took part in the subsequent <unk> Campaign and the Italian Campaign from 1943 until the end of the war .
The RAAF &apos; s role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia &apos; s main contribution to the defeat of Germany .
<unk> 13 @ , @ 000 Australian airmen served in <unk> of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF &lt; unk &gt; Command between 1940 and the end of the war .
Australians took part in all of &lt; unk &gt; Command &apos; s major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France .
Australian <unk> in &lt; unk &gt; Command had one of the highest <unk> <unk> of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat ; 3 @ , @ <unk> were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner .
Australian airmen in light <unk> and fighter squadrons also participated in the <unk> of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945 and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic .
= = = Asia and the Pacific = = = From the 1920s Australia &apos; s defence thinking was dominated by British Imperial defence policy , which was <unk> by the &quot; Singapore strategy &quot; .
This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would <unk> to Japanese <unk> in the region .
To this end , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased .
However , as a result of the emphasis on co @ - @ operation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units had been retained in Australia and the Asia @ - @ Pacific region .
<unk> were taken to improve Australia &apos; s defences as war with Japan &lt; unk &gt; in 1941 , but these proved <unk> .
In December 1941 , the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and <unk> divisions in Australia .
The RAAF was <unk> with <unk> aircraft , most of which were <unk> <unk> , and the &lt; unk &gt; had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters .
The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the Pacific War .
The 8th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller Japanese invasion force which landed on 7 December .
The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of January , but was forced to surrender on 15 February after the Japanese captured much of the island .
<unk> Australian forces were also <unk> and defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul , and in <unk> , Timor , and Java .
The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the Japanese on 19 February , to prevent it from being used as an Allied base .
Over 22 @ , @ 000 Australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and <unk> <unk> conditions in Japanese <unk> .
The prisoners were <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; , denied medical treatment and frequently <unk> and killed by their guards .
As a result , 8 @ , @ <unk> Australian prisoners died in <unk> .
The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the Japanese would <unk> the Australian mainland .
While elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy proposed this in early 1942 , it was <unk> to be impossible by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy of <unk> Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , <unk> , Samoa , and New <unk> .
This fact was not known by the Allies at the time , and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion .
<unk> numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early 1942 , and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas <unk> in March .
Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 .
After an attempt to land troops at Port <unk> was defeated in the Battle of the <unk> Sea , the Japanese attempted to capture the <unk> important town by advancing <unk> across the <unk> Stanley <unk> and Milne Bay .
Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the &lt; unk &gt; Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and <unk> .
Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of <unk> in the hard @ - @ fought Battle of &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; .
The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of &lt; unk &gt; in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ <unk> campaign in April .
In late 1943 , the 7th and 9th <unk> played an important role in Operation &lt; unk &gt; , when they landed to the east and west of <unk> and secured the &lt; unk &gt; Peninsula during the &lt; unk &gt; Peninsula campaign and &lt; unk &gt; Range campaign .
The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 .
Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943 .
These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea , but were unsuccessful .
Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to <unk> the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies ( &lt; unk &gt; ) .
Australia &apos; s role in the Pacific War declined from 1944 .
The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific <unk> the Australian military <unk> and <unk> shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production .
Nevertheless , the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active , and agreed to <unk> &apos; s <unk> that it be used in relatively <unk> campaigns .
In late 1944 , Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US <unk> in eastern New Guinea , New Britain , and &lt; unk &gt; , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there .
In May 1945 , I Corps , the Australian First <unk> Air Force and <unk> and <unk> units began the Borneo Campaign , which continued until the end of the war .
These campaigns contributed little to Japan &apos; s defeat and remain controversial .
Following Japan &apos; s surrender on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed responsibility for <unk> much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored .

From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under @ - @ strength battalion .

3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965 , and served in &lt; unk &gt; until the end of July , operating on both sides of the border .
The battalion had four major <unk> with Indonesian forces and several smaller ones — including at <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the &lt; unk &gt; — as well as suffering casualties in two <unk> incidents .
4 RAR served a less @ - @ <unk> tour between April and August 1966 , and also operated over the border , successfully &lt; unk &gt; with the &lt; unk &gt; on a number of occasions .
A squadron of the Special Air Service Regiment ( &lt; unk &gt; ) was also deployed in 1965 and again in 1966 , taking part in cross @ - @ border operations and <unk> significant casualties on the &lt; unk &gt; , even though they were often tasked with <unk> reconnaissance .
Other units included artillery and engineers , while a number of &lt; unk &gt; ships were involved in <unk> Indonesian positions in Borneo and in &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in the Singapore <unk> .
The RAAF played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war <unk> .
Operations in Borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press <unk> in Australia , while official <unk> of involvement in cross @ - @ border missions only occurred in 1996 .
Following a military <unk> in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General &lt; unk &gt; to power , a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict .

= = = Vietnam War , 1962 – 73 = = = Australia &apos; s involvement in the Vietnam War was driven largely by the rise of <unk> in Southeast Asia after the Second World War , and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s .
As a consequence , Australia supported South Vietnam throughout the early 1960s .
In 1961 and 1962 , the leader of the South <unk> government , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , asked for assistance from the US and its allies in response to a growing <unk> supported by communist North Vietnam .
Australia offered 30 military <unk> from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam , which became known simply as &quot; The Team &quot; .
They arrived in July and August 1962 , beginning Australia &apos; s involvement in the war .
Later in August 1964 , the RAAF sent a flight of &lt; unk &gt; transport aircraft to the port city of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
However , with the security situation in South Vietnam continuing to <unk> , the US increased its involvement to 200 @ , @ 000 combat troops by early 1965 .
Australia also committed ground forces , <unk> the 1 RAR to serve with the US &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Brigade in &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Operation &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
In March 1966 , the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade @ - @ <unk> unit — the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 &lt; unk &gt; ) — to replace 1 RAR .

&lt; unk &gt; of two infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , in &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Province .

9 Squadron RAAF .
At the Battle of Long <unk> on 18 August 1966 , D Company , 6 RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a <unk> <unk> force that was at least six times <unk> than itself .
18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded , while <unk> communist dead were later recovered from the <unk> .
The battle allowed the Australians to gain <unk> over &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Province and 1 &lt; unk &gt; was not <unk> challenged again .
Regardless , during February 1967 the Australians suffered their <unk> casualties in the war to that point , losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week , the bulk during Operation &lt; unk &gt; .
Yet with the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> province coming <unk> under control throughout 1967 , the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further <unk> .
1 &lt; unk &gt; was subsequently deployed &lt; unk &gt; <unk> routes leading to <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; communist movement against the capital as part of Operation &lt; unk &gt; during the 1968 &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and later during the Battle of <unk> – &lt; unk &gt; in May and June 1968 .
At Fire Support &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; the Australians had <unk> with regular North <unk> Army and <unk> <unk> main force units operating in battalion and <unk> strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most <unk> and most sustained battle of the war .
During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and <unk> wounded , while communist casualties included <unk> killed confirmed by body <unk> , 60 possibly killed , 7 wounded and 11 captured .
Other significant Australian actions included <unk> <unk> in June 1969 , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in late @ - @ December 1968 and early 1969 and Long &lt; unk &gt; in June 1971 .
At the height of the Australian commitment , 1 &lt; unk &gt; numbered 8 @ , @ 500 troops , including three infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , <unk> and aviation units in support .
A third RAAF unit , No .
2 Squadron RAAF , flying Canberra bombers , was sent in 1967 , and four &lt; unk &gt; destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam .
The Australian withdrawal <unk> commenced in November 1970 .
As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of <unk> and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of <unk> .
1 &lt; unk &gt; was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , <unk> with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining .
Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a <unk> withdrawal , and 1 &lt; unk &gt; ceased operations in October .
Meanwhile , the <unk> remained to train South <unk> troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973 .
The Vietnam War was Australia &apos; s longest and most controversial war and although initially <unk> broad support , as the nation &apos; s military involvement increased a vocal anti @ - @ war movement developed .

The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military &apos; s experiences in the Vietnam War .
In 1973 , the <unk> of the Department of Defence , Arthur &lt; unk &gt; , submitted a report to the Government that recommended the <unk> of the separate <unk> supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff .
The &lt; unk &gt; Labor Government subsequently <unk> the five defence &lt; unk &gt; ( Defence , Navy , Army , Air Force , and <unk> ) into a single Department of Defence in 1973 , while <unk> under the National Service scheme was <unk> .

In line with this goal , the &lt; unk &gt; was &lt; unk &gt; to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on <unk> Australia .
This was achieved by increasing the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; and RAAF , and <unk> regular Army units to Northern Australia .
During this time the &lt; unk &gt; had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia .

However , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973 , and the two &lt; unk &gt; fighter squadrons in 1988 .
Since then a detachment of <unk> maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as <unk> Company &lt; unk &gt; have been maintained , as well as <unk> <unk> of F / A @ - @ 18 &lt; unk &gt; fighter aircraft .

Churchill was fired on July 24 , 2007 , leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the &quot; Little &lt; unk &gt; &quot; <unk> .
Churchill filed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado for <unk> <unk> of employment .
In April 2009 a Denver jury found that Churchill was <unk> fired , &lt; unk &gt; him $ 1 in damages .
In July 2009 , a District Court judge <unk> the <unk> award and declined Churchill &apos; s request to order his &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> the university has &quot; <unk> @ - @ <unk> <unk> &quot; .
In February 2010 , Churchill appealed the judge &apos; s decision .
In November 2010 , the Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the lower @ - @ court &apos; s ruling .
In September 10 , 2012 , the Colorado Supreme Court upheld the lower courts &apos; <unk> in favor of the University of Colorado .
On April 1 , 2013 , the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case .
In a February 2014 interview , Churchill commented that after living more than <unk> years in the northern <unk> / Colorado region , he had relocated to Atlanta , Georgia in 2013 .
Churchill also stated that he had a half @ - @ <unk> <unk> books which he intended to finish and <unk> in the next three years .
= = Early life and education = = Churchill was born in &lt; unk &gt; , Illinois , to Jack &lt; unk &gt; Churchill and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
His parents <unk> before he was two , and he grew up in &lt; unk &gt; , where he attended local schools .
In 1966 , he was drafted into the United States Army .
On his 1980 resume , he said he served as a public @ - @ information specialist who &quot; wrote and edited the battalion &lt; unk &gt; and wrote news releases . &quot;
In a 1987 <unk> on Churchill , the Denver Post reported that he was drafted , went to <unk> school , then volunteered for Vietnam , where he served a 10 @ - @ month tour as Long Range <unk> <unk> ( &lt; unk &gt; ) , one of a six @ - @ man team sent out to track down the enemy .
The Post article also reported that Churchill was <unk> &lt; unk &gt; as a result of his experiences in Vietnam .
Churchill told the Post that he had spent some time at the <unk> office of the <unk> for a Democratic Society ( &lt; unk &gt; ) in the late 1960s , and briefly <unk> members of the <unk> <unk> how to build <unk> and fire weapons .
In 2005 , the Denver Post reported that Churchill &apos; s military records show he was trained as a film &lt; unk &gt; and light <unk> driver , but they do not reflect <unk> school or &lt; unk &gt; training .
The <unk> <unk> Regiment Association found no record of Churchill having been a member of the unit , or a &lt; unk &gt; team .
Churchill received his &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> communications in 1974 and &lt; unk &gt; in communications <unk> in 1975 , both from &lt; unk &gt; State University , now the University of Illinois at Springfield .
= = <unk> = = In 1978 , Churchill began working at the University of Colorado Boulder as an &lt; unk &gt; action officer in the university administration .
He also &lt; unk &gt; on American Indian issues in the ethnic studies program .
In 1990 , the University of Colorado hired him as an associate professor , although he did not <unk> the academic <unk> usually required for the position .
The following year he was granted <unk> in the <unk> department , without the usual six @ - @ year &lt; unk &gt; period , after having been declined by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He has long been interested in issues associated with the &lt; unk &gt; Act , which broke up the <unk> <unk> lands and assigned <unk> to individual households .
&lt; unk &gt; with that was the federal government &apos; s first use of &quot; blood quantum &quot; to <unk> individual membership in tribes , for what became known as the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Since re @ - @ establishing self @ - @ governments , &lt; unk &gt; <unk> tribes have established their own <unk> for <unk> as members , often related to <unk> from <unk> historical <unk> , but less often requiring <unk> of blood quantum .
Some of his published works address these issues , which he has <unk> as part of the federal government &apos; s policy of &lt; unk &gt; against Native Americans .
In 1995 Churchill discussed his views with David &lt; unk &gt; in an interview : You could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ America .
But in <unk> @ - @ America , while there was some <unk> with it , it was not <unk> until the passage of the General &lt; unk &gt; Act , mid @ - @ 1880s .
At that point they began to <unk> Indian as being someone who was &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; of at least one @ - @ quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group .
You <unk> &apos; t be an eighth <unk> and an eighth &lt; unk &gt; and be an Indian .
You had to be a quarter <unk> or a quarter &lt; unk &gt; or <unk> a quarter and a quarter .
The reason for this was quite clear .
They were <unk> Indians for purposes of &lt; unk &gt; them individual &lt; unk &gt; of land in the existing <unk> base at that point .
If they ran out of Indians <unk> as such , then the rest of the land would be declared <unk> .
So it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; that would <unk> the number of Indians that were available .
It was an economic <unk> for the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; in the first place .
It &apos; s become increasingly so ever since . &quot;

In 1996 , Churchill moved to the new &lt; unk &gt; <unk> Department of the University of Colorado .
In 1997 , he was promoted to full professor .
He was selected as <unk> of the department in June 2002 .
In January 2005 , during the controversy over his 9 / 11 <unk> , Churchill <unk> as <unk> of the ethnic studies department at the University of Colorado — his term as chair was scheduled to &lt; unk &gt; in June of that year .
On May 16 , 2006 , the &lt; unk &gt; Committee of the Standing Committee on Research &lt; unk &gt; at the University of Colorado concluded that Churchill had committed multiple <unk> of academic &lt; unk &gt; , specifically <unk> , <unk> , and &lt; unk &gt; .
On July 24 , 2007 , Churchill was fired for academic &lt; unk &gt; in an eight to one vote by the University of Colorado &apos; s Board of &lt; unk &gt; .

In 1992 , Churchill wrote elsewhere that he is one @ - @ eighth Creek and one @ - @ sixteenth &lt; unk &gt; .
In 1993 , Churchill told the Colorado Daily that &quot; he was one @ - @ sixteenth Creek and &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
Churchill told the Denver Post in February 2005 that he is three @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
In a statement dated May 9 , 2005 , and posted on its website , the United &lt; unk &gt; Band initially said , &quot; The United &lt; unk &gt; Band would like to make it clear that Mr. Churchill &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; a member of the &lt; unk &gt; Band and was only given an <unk> &apos; associate membership &apos; in the early 1990s because he could not prove any &lt; unk &gt; ancestry . &quot;
The tribe said that all of Churchill &apos; s &quot; past , present and future claims or &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; &apos; <unk> , &apos; written or <unk> , including but not limited to ; <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , <unk> for employment , or any other reference not listed &lt; unk &gt; , are deemed &lt; unk &gt; by the United &lt; unk &gt; Band . &quot;
Two days later , the United &lt; unk &gt; Band replaced its statement and acknowledged Churchill &apos; s &quot; alleged ancestry &quot; of being &lt; unk &gt; : &quot; Because Mr. Churchill had <unk> information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his <unk> to assist the &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> the tribe and its <unk> , he was awarded an &apos; <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &apos; as an honor , &quot; the tribe &apos; s website now said . &quot;
However , Mr. Churchill may <unk> <unk> status for &lt; unk &gt; <unk> of Oklahoma , since he claims 1 / 16 &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
The tribe &apos; s <unk> , <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , stated the tribe &lt; unk &gt; only members with certified one @ - @ quarter American Indian blood .
The website statement further <unk> that Churchill &quot; was not <unk> for <unk> membership due to the fact that he does not <unk> a &apos; <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; of Indian Blood ( &lt; unk &gt; ) &quot; , and the associate membership did not &lt; unk &gt; an individual to <unk> rights or <unk> in the tribe .
Churchill has never asked for &lt; unk &gt; <unk> , and finds the idea of being &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; by the US government offensive .
In June 1994 , the United &lt; unk &gt; Band had voted to stop &lt; unk &gt; associate &lt; unk &gt; .
Such <unk> associate membership <unk> an individual &apos; s assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with Indian ancestry , and it does not &lt; unk &gt; an individual to vote in the tribe as a member .
The &lt; unk &gt; Band states that Churchill still <unk> the associate membership and it has not been <unk> .
In a separate interview , &lt; unk &gt; Berry , <unk> on the tribe &apos; s <unk> committee and four years on its council , said that Churchill had never <unk> a <unk> to help the tribe .
In June 2005 , the Rocky Mountain News published an article about Churchill &apos; s <unk> and family history .
It &quot; turned up no evidence of a single Indian <unk> &quot; among <unk> direct <unk> &#91; of Churchill &apos; s &#93; identified from records .
The News reported that both Churchill &apos; s birth parents were listed as white on the 1930 census , as were all but two of his great @ - @ great @ - @ <unk> listed on previous census and other official documents .
The News found that some of Churchill &apos; s accounts of where his <unk> had lived did not <unk> with <unk> records .
Numerous members of Churchill &apos; s extended family have <unk> family <unk> of Indian ancestry among <unk> ; but , none was confirmed among the <unk> direct <unk> of Churchill who were identified .
&lt; unk &gt; in Churchill &apos; s university personnel file show that he was granted <unk> in a &quot; special opportunity position . &quot;
In 1994 , then &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ Boulder <unk> James &lt; unk &gt; refused to take action on allegations that Churchill was &lt; unk &gt; claiming to be an Indian , saying &quot; it has always been university policy that a person &apos; s race or <unk> is self @ - @ <unk> . &quot;
Some of Churchill &apos; s Native American critics , such as Vernon &lt; unk &gt; ( White <unk> <unk> ) and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( Southern <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Creek ) , <unk> that his <unk> of Native American ancestry without the ability to prove it might <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and grounds for <unk> .
The University has said that it does not <unk> on the basis of <unk> .
The University of Colorado &apos; s Research &lt; unk &gt; Committee conducted a <unk> investigation into whether Churchill <unk> his <unk> to &quot; add <unk> and public <unk> to his <unk> . &quot;
The committee concluded that the allegation was not &quot; appropriate for further investigation under the <unk> of research &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News , Churchill said , &quot; I have never been confirmed as having one @ - @ quarter blood , and never said I was .
And even if &#91; the critics &#93; are <unk> right , what does that have to do with this issue ?
I have never claimed to be &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> indigenous activist Russell &lt; unk &gt; said in February of that year , &quot; So I want , from this day forward , every media person <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to know that we have &lt; unk &gt; that Ward Churchill is a full @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; Indian leader . &quot;

Churchill <unk> that the United States <unk> blood quantum laws based upon rules of &lt; unk &gt; in order to further goals of personal &lt; unk &gt; and political &lt; unk &gt; .
For decades in his writings , Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an <unk> &lt; unk &gt; purpose .
He says , &quot; <unk> the blood quantum at one @ - @ quarter , hold to it as a <unk> <unk> of Indians , let &lt; unk &gt; <unk> as it &#91; has &#93; and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence &quot; .

He felt the main event had &quot; lots of action and drama , &quot; but that having to <unk> the belt on a <unk> does not make for a &quot; particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems like someone <unk> a <unk> in the corner &quot; than &quot; beating someone to win a fight . &quot;
&lt; unk &gt; said the World Tag Team Championship contest was a &quot; solid <unk> match &quot; with some &quot; elaborate <unk> &quot; that were &quot; well <unk> . &quot;

Regarding the &lt; unk &gt; and Angle bout , &lt; unk &gt; commented that it was a &quot; good match , but short of a classic must @ - @ see match in part because there were too many &lt; unk &gt; mid @ - @ match from Angle that took the crowd out of it . &quot;

He went on to say that he felt it was &quot; missing something &quot; and that it &quot; seemed like the match just never moved out of second <unk> .
Caldwell felt the X Division Championship bout was a &quot; very good opening match , &quot; which &quot; could have been a featured match to sell a few additional &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , but TNA didn &apos; t give the X Division any focus until the final show before the &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;

Regarding the <unk> segment during the show , Caldwell said &quot; it was just a bad , bad , bad segment that died slowly and &lt; unk &gt; in front of the live audience . &quot;

The film is a comedy of <unk> , in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner .
The focus of the humor is in a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; that <unk> is added to in an attempt to make it more &lt; unk &gt; , but three people each add <unk> to the &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> becomes &lt; unk &gt; upon <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; , including the family <unk> , and the film <unk> .
No cast or staff credits for this film are known .
The film was released on September 27 , 1910 , to mixed reviews in trade publications .
<unk> mentioned that the film was too long and it was <unk> that one &lt; unk &gt; split eight ways would be able to impact everyone .
The film is <unk> lost .
= = Plot = = Though the film is <unk> lost , a <unk> survives in The Moving <unk> World from September 24 , 1910 .
It states : &quot; Life in a country town is often <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; , and were it not for the little &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; the &lt; unk &gt; are <unk> given , existence in some <unk> would be a very <unk> thing <unk> .
So the time honored get @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; of the small town are an established feature to the social <unk> ; they are just as much a matter of <unk> and as such have come to stay .
The &lt; unk &gt; thought well of this established feature .
They made it a &lt; unk &gt; occasion for themselves as well as their guests .
They were <unk> an <unk> <unk> family , and their table was never notable for an &lt; unk &gt; of the good things of life , but <unk> they gave a dinner they cast all <unk> of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a <unk> time . &quot;
&quot; On the night before such an event neither &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , or &lt; unk &gt; Gale could get those minutes &apos; solid <unk> for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests &apos; <unk> .
At the first &lt; unk &gt; of the <unk> they would come <unk> down to the <unk> to get the &lt; unk &gt; into shape .
So little <unk> that on occasion of the dinner here <unk> - when the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; - the &lt; unk &gt; were ever looking after the need of the said &lt; unk &gt; .
First &lt; unk &gt; Gale would &lt; unk &gt; to the table <unk> it <unk> in <unk> state , and give it a <unk> ; then &lt; unk &gt; Gale would &lt; unk &gt; over and give it a <unk> ; finally &lt; unk &gt; Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise .
Then arrived the guests .
The Minister and the <unk> Minister , they were , and some <unk> .
While she was receiving them the <unk> came to &lt; unk &gt; Gale that the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; had not received its &lt; unk &gt; .
Off she <unk> to a &lt; unk &gt; of whiskey in the <unk> .
She &lt; unk &gt; into the &lt; unk &gt; the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests .
Then &lt; unk &gt; Gale <unk> that the &lt; unk &gt; has not been <unk> .
He , too , &lt; unk &gt; himself and a moment later is found <unk> whiskey into the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
No <unk> has he ceased and returned to his guest than &lt; unk &gt; Gale , who has just remembered about the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> in and makes for the whiskey .
She &lt; unk &gt; &apos; the right proportion &apos; in , too . &quot;
= = Production = = The writer of the <unk> is unknown , but it was most likely <unk> <unk> .
He was an experienced &lt; unk &gt; employed by The New York <unk> World while writing <unk> for the Thanhouser productions .
The film director is unknown , but it may have been <unk> O &apos; <unk> .
Film historian <unk> David <unk> does not <unk> a <unk> for this production , but at least two possible candidates <unk> .
<unk> Smith was the first <unk> of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by <unk> Louis <unk> who had years of experience as a still and motion picture <unk> .
The role of the <unk> was &lt; unk &gt; in 1910 productions .
The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are <unk> .
In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important <unk> in their films .
The list includes &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; D. <unk> , Frank H. <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Marie &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; , Martin J. <unk> , Thomas <unk> , George <unk> , <unk> Moore , John W. <unk> , Anna &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> George <unk> .
A surviving film still gives the possibility of <unk> eight actors .
= = Release and reception = = The single <unk> comedy , approximately 1 @ , @ 000 feet long , was released on September 27 , 1910 .
The film likely had a wide national release , with <unk> in <unk> known in <unk> , Kansas , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania .
The film would also be shown in Vancouver , Canada and was met with praise by the audience at the Province Theatre .
In 1917 , years after the film &apos; s release , the film was approved without <unk> by the Pennsylvania State Board of &lt; unk &gt; of Moving <unk> .
The The Moving <unk> World reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a <unk> .
The reviewer states , &quot; A domestic comedy with a different <unk> .
In fact , with a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; for a basis the <unk> comes to <unk> <unk> very strongly by the time that the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> of the house and her daughter have added the <unk> proportion of &lt; unk &gt; , neither one <unk> that the others have done likewise .
The humor in this piece centers around this &lt; unk &gt; .
What happened to the guests who &lt; unk &gt; of it <unk> <unk> upon the <unk> .
<unk> eight people , not to speak of the <unk> , getting <unk> on the <unk> in one &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; !
... We do not single out this subject as being more <unk> <unk> than others shown on the screen this week .
&lt; unk &gt; as well as &lt; unk &gt; were guilty and it is time that the <unk> realize the importance of the <unk> end of <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; episode was well done , which is the <unk> praise that we do not like to &lt; unk &gt; out to anyone . &quot;
<unk> of The Moving <unk> News was not &lt; unk &gt; by the plot and stated , &quot; To me the last scene had no humor .
It was only the necessary ending to the beginning .
<unk> humor does not &lt; unk &gt; from &lt; unk &gt; . &quot;
The New York <unk> <unk> stated , &quot; This is the old story of too many <unk> , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way .
The early part of the film takes too much time with <unk> details leading up to the final situation .
... A weak point in the story is the fact that the &lt; unk &gt; is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power .
Two &lt; unk &gt; would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more <unk> .
The character parts are all well taken , although the <unk> would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera . &quot;
= Back Off &lt; unk &gt; = &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; is a song by English musician &lt; unk &gt; Starr , released as a non @ - @ album single in March 1972 .
Starr &apos; s former Beatles &lt; unk &gt; George Harrison produced the recording , which took place in London shortly after the two had appeared together at Harrison &apos; s <unk> for <unk> shows in August 1971 .
The single was a follow @ - @ up to Starr &apos; s 1971 hit song &quot; It Don &apos; t Come Easy &quot; and continued his successful run as a solo artist . &quot;

It remains Starr &apos; s highest @ - @ <unk> single in the United Kingdom .
The title for the song was inspired by English singer @ - @ songwriter <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Some <unk> have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney , <unk> Starr &apos; s <unk> for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years . &quot;
Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; <unk> the influence of &lt; unk &gt; rock on Starr , who directed a documentary film , Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , about &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s band T. Rex around this time .
<unk> by one author as a &quot; high @ - @ <unk> in @ - @ your @ - @ face <unk> &quot; , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and <unk> from musicians Gary Wright and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
Starr re @ - @ recorded &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; for his 1981 album <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; the Roses , in a <unk> with American singer Harry Nilsson that <unk> lyrics from Beatles songs such as &quot; With a Little <unk> from My <unk> &quot; , &quot; Good Day <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> , You &apos; re a Rich Man &quot; .
The original version has appeared on Starr &apos; s compilation albums &lt; unk &gt; from Your Past and &lt; unk &gt; : The <unk> Best of &lt; unk &gt; Starr , and as a bonus track on his <unk> 1974 studio album &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
Since his return to touring in 1989 , Starr has performed &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; regularly in concert with the various &lt; unk &gt; of his All @ - @ Starr Band .
= = Background and composition = = &lt; unk &gt; Starr identified his initial <unk> for &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; as having come from <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , the singer and guitarist with English &lt; unk &gt; rock band T. Rex .
In a 2001 interview with &lt; unk &gt; editor Paul <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , Starr described &lt; unk &gt; as &quot; a <unk> friend who used to come into the office when I was running Apple <unk> , a big office in town , and the <unk> @ - @ out for myself , Harry Nilsson and <unk> Moon &quot; .
Over dinner one evening at Starr &apos; s home outside London , &lt; unk &gt; had used the word &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; so often that it <unk> in Starr &apos; s mind , after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight .
When <unk> the composition on <unk> &lt; unk &gt; in May 1998 , Starr explained : &quot; &#91; &lt; unk &gt; &#93; was an &lt; unk &gt; guy .
He used to speak : &apos; Back off &lt; unk &gt; ... &lt; unk &gt; you , &lt; unk &gt; . &apos;
&apos; <unk> you want some <unk> ? &apos;
&apos; &lt; unk &gt; you , &lt; unk &gt; ! &apos;
&quot; Starr also <unk> having to take the <unk> out of his children &apos; s <unk> that night , in order to power a tape <unk> and make a recording of the new song .
The lyrics to the middle eight of &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; came to Starr while watching London <unk> Television &apos; s football show , The Big <unk> .
The program &apos; s host , <unk> Hill , often referred to a <unk> &apos; s playing as &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , a <unk> that Starr incorporated into his song lyrics : Get <unk> together now And give me something &lt; unk &gt; <unk> you try to do You know it sure <unk> <unk> .
<unk> have <unk> the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by Starr on his former Beatles &lt; unk &gt; Paul McCartney .
Starr has denied any such <unk> , instead &quot; claiming that the song was inspired by &lt; unk &gt; and nothing more &quot; , Beatles <unk> Robert Rodriguez writes .
Starr had publicly criticised McCartney &apos; s solo albums McCartney ( 1970 ) and <unk> ( 1971 ) on release , and author <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; the message of the middle eight as &quot; a plea for Paul to produce better music &quot; .
The mention of &quot; sound &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> &quot; could also be a reference to McCartney &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; with <unk> , Rodriguez suggests .
A further example of Starr &apos; s <unk> anti @ - @ McCartney message exists in the song &apos; s first verse : <unk> up , &lt; unk &gt; Don &apos; t <unk> that you are dead Get <unk> up off the <unk> .
The same <unk> <unk> that here Starr could be referring to the 1969 &quot; Paul Is <unk> &quot; <unk> .
The latter &lt; unk &gt; <unk> during September and October of that year while McCartney <unk> away on his Scottish <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; after John Lennon had told him and Starr that he wanted a &quot; <unk> &quot; from the Beatles .
In addition to these supposed <unk> in &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , observers have viewed the song title as Starr &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps , which was placed in <unk> in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in McCartney &apos; s favour .
<unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; writes that &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; had &quot; long been cited as Paul &apos; s <unk> &quot; from his former <unk> Starr , Lennon and George Harrison .
While <unk> that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to <unk> any ill @ - @ feeling towards McCartney , Rodriguez notes that the lyrics &quot; just happened to fit <unk> into the &apos; us <unk> Paul &apos; <unk> &quot; following the Beatles &apos; break @ - @ up , to the <unk> that &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; was &quot; as &lt; unk &gt; as &apos; Early 1970 &apos; had been &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
When &lt; unk &gt; his 1970 composition &quot; I &apos; m the <unk> &quot; for Starr to record on the album &lt; unk &gt; ( 1973 ) , Lennon <unk> the song title with the lines &quot; <unk> I &apos; m only thirty @ - @ two / And all I want to do is &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
Although &quot; T Rex <unk> &quot; , in the words of Starr <unk> Alan &lt; unk &gt; , claimed that &lt; unk &gt; had <unk> @ - @ written &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , Starr later acknowledged that Harrison co @ - @ wrote the song by adding some <unk> and finishing the melody .
As on Starr &apos; s 1971 hit single &quot; It Don &apos; t Come Easy &quot; , Harrison was not <unk> for his <unk> contribution .
Starr originally offered &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; to fellow &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; Black to record , but she declined , hoping instead to record another new Starr – Harrison composition , &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .

= = Release and reception = = Apple Records issued the single on 17 March 1972 in Britain , as Apple R &lt; unk &gt; , with a US release taking place three days later , as Apple <unk> .
It was Starr &apos; s first release since &quot; It Don &apos; t Come Easy &quot; , a year before .
During this period , his <unk> had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as 200 &lt; unk &gt; ( 1971 ) and &lt; unk &gt; .

With &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; , NME critic Bob &lt; unk &gt; noted Starr &apos; s success in establishing himself in the two years since the Beatles &apos; break @ - @ up , and wrote that the single &quot; confirmed that he and Harrison , dark horses both , were the ones who had managed their solo <unk> more <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; &quot; compared with McCartney and Lennon .
The song was a hit in the US , reaching number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 , and achieved Starr &apos; s best position on the UK Singles Chart , where it reached number 2 .

Alan &lt; unk &gt; writes of reviewers <unk> &quot; Back Off &lt; unk &gt; &quot; for being &lt; unk &gt; , leading Starr to <unk> in a 1973 interview : &quot; Play me a pop song that <unk> &apos; t . &quot;
On release , Chris <unk> wrote in <unk> <unk> : &quot; A <unk> One hit could easily be in store for the &lt; unk &gt; of rock drums .

It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album &apos; s third single in August 1987 .
The song &apos; s <unk> is a repeating guitar &lt; unk &gt; using a delay effect , played during the song &apos; s introduction and again at the end .
Lead <unk> Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the <unk> that it is possible to identify a person &apos; s religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in <unk> .
During the band &apos; s difficulties recording the song , producer <unk> Eno considered &lt; unk &gt; the song &apos; s <unk> to have them start from <unk> . &quot;
Where the Streets Have No Name &quot; was praised by critics and became a commercial success , <unk> at number <unk> in the US , number fourteen in Canada , number ten in the Netherlands , and number four in the United Kingdom .
The song has remained a <unk> of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour .
The song was performed on a Los Angeles &lt; unk &gt; for the filming of its music video , which won a <unk> Award for Best Performance Music Video .
= = <unk> and recording = = The music for &quot; Where the Streets Have No Name &quot; <unk> from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions .
In an <unk> room at &lt; unk &gt; House — his newly purchased home — The Edge used a four @ - @ track tape machine to record an arrangement of <unk> , bass , guitar , and a <unk> machine .
&lt; unk &gt; that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on <unk> live songs , The Edge wanted to &quot; &lt; unk &gt; up the <unk> U2 live @ - @ song &quot; , so he <unk> what he would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan .
After finishing the <unk> mix , he felt he had come up with &quot; the most <unk> guitar part and song of &#91; his &#93; life &quot; .
With no one in the house to share the demo with , The Edge <unk> <unk> around and <unk> the air in <unk> .
Although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> Clayton said , &quot; At the time it <unk> like a foreign language , whereas now we <unk> how it works &quot; .
The arrangement , with two time signature <unk> and <unk> <unk> changes , was &lt; unk &gt; many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked .
According to co @ - @ producer Daniel <unk> , &quot; that was the <unk> project song .
I <unk> having this massive <unk> &lt; unk &gt; , as we call them .
I was holding a <unk> , like a college professor , walking the band through the <unk> changes like a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
It was <unk> . &quot;
Co @ - @ producer <unk> Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a <unk> version of &quot; Where the Streets Have No Name &quot; .
The band worked on a single take for weeks , but as Eno explained , that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to <unk> it up .
Through all of their work , they had gradually replaced each <unk> take until nothing remained from the original performance .
So much time had been spent on &quot; &lt; unk &gt; work &quot; that Eno thought it would be best to start from <unk> .
His idea was to &quot; stage an <unk> &quot; and have the song &apos; s <unk> <unk> .
He said that this was not to force <unk> of the song , but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance .
At one point , Eno had the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; up and ready to be recorded over , but this &lt; unk &gt; never took place ; according to engineer <unk> , fellow engineer <unk> McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to <unk> the <unk> , dropped the &lt; unk &gt; of <unk> he was carrying and <unk> <unk> Eno .
The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes .
It was one of several songs mixed by Steve &lt; unk &gt; in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree .
<unk> Larry <unk> , <unk> later said of the song , &quot; It took so long to get that song right , it was difficult for us to make any sense of it .
It only became a truly great song through playing live .
On the record , <unk> , it &apos; s not half the song it is live . &quot;
= = <unk> = = &quot; Where the Streets Have No Name &quot; is played at a tempo of <unk> beats per minute .
The introduction and &lt; unk &gt; are played in a 3 / 4 time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common 4 / 4 signature .
The songs <unk> with an <unk> section , starting with &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ like sustained &lt; unk &gt; notes .
The guitar <unk> in after 42 seconds ; this part consists of a repeated &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; six @ - @ note &lt; unk &gt; .
A &quot; <unk> eighth &quot; delay effect is used to &quot; play &quot; each note in the &lt; unk &gt; twice , thus creating a rich sound .
The bass and drums enter at 1 : 10 .
The introduction , following a I – IV – I – IV – <unk> – V – I <unk> <unk> , <unk> a &quot; wall of sound &quot; , as described by Mark <unk> , against which the vocals <unk> after nearly two minutes .
The guitar part played for the remainder of the song features The Edge <unk> &lt; unk &gt; sixteenth notes .
The bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while Bono &apos; s vocal performance , in contrast , <unk> greatly in its &lt; unk &gt; , ( &quot; he &lt; unk &gt; ; he &lt; unk &gt; ; he &lt; unk &gt; ; he &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ; he allows his voice to <unk> &quot; ) as well as <unk> by his usage of &lt; unk &gt; to slightly <unk> the notes he <unk> from the beat .
This development <unk> a <unk> during the first chorus at the line &quot; burning down love &quot; ( A – <unk> – F <unk> – D ) ; the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song , the &lt; unk &gt; at &quot; burning &quot; .
In later <unk> , Bono <unk> &quot; <unk> by the wind &quot; with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer .
After the third chorus , the song &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; is played , the <unk> <unk> to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a six @ - @ note guitar &lt; unk &gt; played against sustained &lt; unk &gt; notes .
= = <unk> = = The lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about the streets of <unk> , Northern Ireland , where a person &apos; s religion and income are <unk> by the street they live on .
He <unk> this with the &lt; unk &gt; he felt when visiting <unk> , saying : &quot; ... the guy in the song <unk> this contrast and <unk> about a world where there <unk> &apos; t such divisions , a place where the streets have no name .
To me , that &apos; s the way a great rock &apos; <unk> &apos; roll concert should be : a place where everyone comes together ... <unk> that &apos; s the dream of all art : to break down the <unk> and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all . &quot;
Bono wrote the lyrics while on a <unk> visit to <unk> with his wife , <unk> <unk> ; he first wrote them down on an &lt; unk &gt; <unk> while staying in a village .
According to him , the song is <unk> about &quot; &lt; unk &gt; , elevation , <unk> you want to call it . &quot;
Bono , who compared many of his lyrics prior to The Joshua Tree to &quot; <unk> &quot; , said that &quot; &apos; Where the Streets Have No Name &apos; is more like the U2 of old than any of the other songs on the <unk> , because it &apos; s a <unk> — I was just trying to <unk> a location , <unk> a <unk> location , <unk> a romantic location .
I was trying to <unk> a feeling . &quot;
The open @ - @ ended nature of the lyrics has led to many <unk> .
<unk> Michael <unk> believed the lyrics send &quot; a message of <unk> &quot; and wish for a &quot; world that is not divided by class , <unk> , race , or any other <unk> <unk> &quot; .
With <unk> to the place Bono was referring to in the song , he said , &quot; I &apos; m not sure , really , about that .
I used to think it was <unk> ... &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> believes the title was influenced by Bono &apos; s and his wife <unk> &apos; s visit to <unk> as volunteer aid @ - @ workers .
Bono has expressed mixed <unk> about the open @ - @ ended lyrics : &quot; I can look at it now and <unk> that &#91; the song &#93; has one of the most &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in the history of pop music .
But it also contains some of the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> way , that seems to work .
If you get any way heavy about these things , you don &apos; t <unk> .
But if you &apos; re <unk> or &lt; unk &gt; about it , then you do .
That &apos; s one of the &lt; unk &gt; I &apos; ve come to terms with . &quot;

Critics <unk> the song in the group &apos; s <unk> : The <unk> said the song &quot; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> , as U2 do what they &apos; re best at , <unk> into epic rock <unk> , playing music made for the <unk> &quot; .
In two other local newspaper reviews , critics praised the song &apos; s <unk> in a sequence of greatest hits .
For the <unk> Tour of 1997 – 1998 , U2 returned to the <unk> dance arrangement they occasionally played on the Zoo TV Tour .
The set &apos; s massive video screen displayed a video that Hot Press described as an &quot; <unk> , 2001 @ - @ style trip into the heart of a &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> tunnel that <unk> the audience in towards a <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
Near the end of the song , peace &lt; unk &gt; were shown on the screen and <unk> beams of light <unk> the set &apos; s <unk> arch were <unk> <unk> .
Hot Press said the effect transformed the stadium into a &quot; <unk> landing site &quot; .
Shortly before the third leg of the &lt; unk &gt; Tour , the September 11 attacks occurred in New York City and Washington <unk> During the band &apos; s first show in New York City following the attacks , the band performed &quot; Where the Streets Have No Name &quot; , and when the stage <unk> <unk> the audience , the band saw <unk> <unk> down the <unk> of many fans .
The experience was one <unk> for the song &quot; City of &lt; unk &gt; Lights &quot; .
The band paid tribute to the 9 / 11 victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl &lt; unk &gt; <unk> show on 3 February 2002 .
The performance featured the names of the September 11 victims <unk> onto a large white <unk> behind the band .
U2 &apos; s appearance was later ranked number 1 on Sports <unk> &apos; s list of &quot; <unk> 10 Super Bowl &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; .
For the <unk> Tour , the group originally considered dropping the song from their &lt; unk &gt; , but <unk> and Clayton successfully argued against this .
All 131 of the <unk> Tour concerts featured a performance of the song , which were accompanied by the stage &apos; s <unk> video &lt; unk &gt; <unk> African <unk> .
On the tour &apos; s opening night , this <unk> Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an <unk> village .
He thought this <unk> <unk> made the song come full circle , saying , &quot; And here it was , nearly twenty years later , coming back to Africa , all the <unk> about &lt; unk &gt; lands and &lt; unk &gt; making sense for the first time . &quot;
The song was also played at the <unk> <unk> of the band &apos; s concert film U2 3D at the 2007 <unk> Film Festival .
At the <unk> Festival 2010 , The Edge accompanied rock band &lt; unk &gt; for a live cover version of the track , later playing it with U2 while <unk> <unk> in 2011 .

= = Track listing = = = = Personnel = = = = <unk> = = = &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; reaction = The &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; reaction ( often referred to as simply the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ) is a <unk> reaction used in <unk> chemistry for the synthesis of &lt; unk &gt; .
The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the <unk> and substrates employed .
It was originally discovered by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ( 1906 – 1957 ) in 1941 while <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; vinyl &lt; unk &gt; .
As originally described , the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; involves the <unk> of a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; using a <unk> Lewis acid or &lt; unk &gt; acid promoter .
The key step of the reaction mechanism involves a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; ring <unk> which forms the &lt; unk &gt; product ( <unk> &lt; unk &gt; below ) .
As the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; other than Lewis <unk> have been <unk> under the name &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; provided that they follow a similar &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
The success of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; as a <unk> in <unk> synthesis stems from the <unk> and &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; as both <unk> in natural products ( including &lt; unk &gt; , the &lt; unk &gt; , and a &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; ) and as <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; for total synthesis .
The reaction has been used in several total <unk> and several reviews have been published .
= = &lt; unk &gt; = = The mechanism of the classical &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; reaction was first demonstrated <unk> by &lt; unk &gt; to be an &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and is <unk> below .
&lt; unk &gt; of the &lt; unk &gt; by the acid <unk> generates a &lt; unk &gt; cation which <unk> a &lt; unk &gt; allowed &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; as <unk> by the <unk> @ - @ <unk> rules .
This generates an &lt; unk &gt; cation which <unk> an elimination reaction to <unk> a β @ - @ <unk> .
<unk> &lt; unk &gt; of the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; product .
As noted above , variants that <unk> from this <unk> are known ; what &lt; unk &gt; a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in particular is the generation of the &lt; unk &gt; cation followed by &lt; unk &gt; ring <unk> to an &lt; unk &gt; cation .
In order to achieve this <unk> , the <unk> must be in the s @ - @ trans / s @ - @ trans <unk> , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate <unk> .
The &lt; unk &gt; of the system to enter this <unk> <unk> <unk> reaction rate , with α @ - @ <unk> substrates having an increased population of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; due to &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; of an electron &lt; unk &gt; α @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; by the <unk> can likewise increase the reaction rate by <unk> this <unk> .
<unk> , β @ - @ <unk> directed <unk> &lt; unk &gt; the s @ - @ trans <unk> so <unk> that E @ - @ <unk> &lt; unk &gt; has been shown to occur in advance of &lt; unk &gt; on a wide range of substrates , <unk> the trans &lt; unk &gt; regardless of initial <unk> .
In this way , the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; is a rare example of a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; reaction , whereas most &lt; unk &gt; are &lt; unk &gt; .
The example below uses &lt; unk &gt; <unk> to <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; cation so that no elimination occurs .
( <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; below ) Along this same <unk> , &lt; unk &gt; vinyl &lt; unk &gt; of the type studied extensively by <unk> &lt; unk &gt; of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate <unk> due to the removal of β @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; a large amount of &lt; unk &gt; <unk> in the s @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
= = <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; = = Though &lt; unk &gt; following the general <unk> above had been <unk> prior to &lt; unk &gt; &apos; s involvement , it was his study of the &lt; unk &gt; of &lt; unk &gt; vinyl &lt; unk &gt; that marked the first major <unk> of this process .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> that the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in <unk> to form a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; before ring <unk> to the &lt; unk &gt; product .
The reaction shown below involves an &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; reaction to <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
Research involving the reaction was relatively <unk> in subsequent years , until in the mid @ - @ 1980s when several <unk> employing the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; were published .
&lt; unk &gt; below are key steps in the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; , the latter of which is thought to <unk> via an unusual &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; that generates the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; = = = The classical version of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> from several <unk> which modern variants attempt to &lt; unk &gt; .
The first two are not <unk> from the mechanism alone , but are <unk> of the <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; ; the last three stem from <unk> issues relating to elimination and &lt; unk &gt; of the intermediate .
<unk> Lewis or &lt; unk &gt; <unk> are typically required for the reaction ( <unk>
&lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; ) .
These &lt; unk &gt; are not <unk> with sensitive <unk> groups , <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Despite the &lt; unk &gt; possibility for <unk> , multiple <unk> of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction .
This limits the <unk> economy of the reaction .
The elimination step is not &lt; unk &gt; ; if multiple β @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; are available for elimination , various products are often <unk> as <unk> .
This is highly <unk> from an <unk> <unk> as &lt; unk &gt; <unk> is typically required .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> a potential &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> the potential <unk> of the reaction .
&lt; unk &gt; of the &lt; unk &gt; is sometimes not &lt; unk &gt; , meaning that products can be formed as <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; .
= = Modern variants = = The <unk> noted above limit the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; reaction in its <unk> form .
However , <unk> to the reaction focused on &lt; unk &gt; its issues continue to be an active area of academic research .
In particular , the research has focused on a few key areas : <unk> the reaction <unk> in the promoter , &lt; unk &gt; the reaction with more <unk> &lt; unk &gt; to improve <unk> group <unk> , directing the &lt; unk &gt; of the elimination step , and <unk> the overall &lt; unk &gt; .
These have been successful to <unk> degrees .
Additionally , <unk> focused on <unk> the progress of the reaction , either by <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; cation in an <unk> fashion or by having the &lt; unk &gt; cation &quot; <unk> &quot; in various ways .
<unk> , <unk> variants of various <unk> have been developed .
The sheer volume of literature on the subject <unk> a <unk> <unk> of this field ; key examples are given below .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ directed &lt; unk &gt; = = = The earliest efforts to improve the <unk> of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; took advantage of the β @ - @ <unk> effect in order to direct the &lt; unk &gt; of the elimination step .
This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott <unk> of the University of Illinois , &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; in the mid @ - @ 1980s and <unk> <unk> <unk> of iron &lt; unk &gt; to promote the reaction .
With &lt; unk &gt; products , the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was selected for to <unk> degrees .
The <unk> @ - @ directed &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product &lt; unk &gt; , shown below .
The &lt; unk &gt; takes place before elimination of the &lt; unk &gt; alcohol &lt; unk &gt; , so that the resulting &lt; unk &gt; of the newly formed ring <unk> from approach of the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; anti to the &lt; unk &gt; .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; = = = <unk> on the &lt; unk &gt; effects compiled over various <unk> of the reaction , Professor <unk> <unk> of the University of <unk> developed a <unk> for &quot; <unk> &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in which electron &lt; unk &gt; and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall <unk> of the reaction .
<unk> of an effective vinyl &lt; unk &gt; and vinyl &lt; unk &gt; in the <unk> allows <unk> <unk> with <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; elimination .
In addition , the electron withdrawing group <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; of the α @ - @ <unk> , allowing <unk> formation of the trans @ - @ α @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; via &lt; unk &gt; .
It is often possible to achieve <unk> <unk> using a &lt; unk &gt; or withdrawing group alone , although the <unk> of the reaction ( <unk> , reaction time , <unk> . )
is typically lower .
= = = <unk> cation generation = = = By extension , any &lt; unk &gt; cation regardless of its origin is capable of <unk> a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
There have been a large number of examples published where the &lt; unk &gt; cation is arrived at by a variety of &lt; unk &gt; .
One such example involves the silver &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; ring opening of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
The silver <unk> <unk> loss of <unk> via precipitation of &lt; unk &gt; silver <unk> .
In the total synthesis of &lt; unk &gt; , &lt; unk &gt; of a vinyl &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; likewise generates a &lt; unk &gt; cation via ring opening of the <unk> &lt; unk &gt; .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; = = = Once the &lt; unk &gt; has occurred , an &lt; unk &gt; cation is formed .
As discussed extensively above , the <unk> course for this intermediate is elimination followed by &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
However , these two steps can be <unk> by various &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; , respectively .
&lt; unk &gt; cation <unk> has been developed extensively by &lt; unk &gt; <unk> West of the University of <unk> and his review covers the field .
The &lt; unk &gt; cation can be trapped with &lt; unk &gt; and <unk> &lt; unk &gt; and can also <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; with various &lt; unk &gt; <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; below is a <unk> reaction in which <unk> cation <unk> generates a &lt; unk &gt; core in one step with complete <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; <unk> with various &lt; unk &gt; is &lt; unk &gt; less common .
In one study , the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; is paired with a Michael reaction using an &lt; unk &gt; <unk> to <unk> <unk> &lt; unk &gt; addition of the &lt; unk &gt; to β @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; .
In this <unk> reaction the &lt; unk &gt; <unk> is required for both &lt; unk &gt; : it acts as the Lewis acid in the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and in the next step the &lt; unk &gt; group of &lt; unk &gt; first <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; in a <unk> exchange with the &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R @ - @ group .
= = = &lt; unk &gt; variants = = = The development of an <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; is a <unk> addition to the <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; reactions .
To that end , several variations have been developed <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; .
&lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; are also known , in which <unk> &lt; unk &gt; direct the &lt; unk &gt; .
<unk> all of the attempts are based on the idea of &lt; unk &gt; ; <unk> one direction for the vinyl groups to &quot; &lt; unk &gt; &quot; in turn <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; as shown below .
&lt; unk &gt; @ - @ directed &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; can exhibit <unk> <unk> in this way .
In the example below , the &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ group acts to direct the &lt; unk &gt; by <unk> the distant &lt; unk &gt; from rotating &quot; towards &quot; it via <unk> &lt; unk &gt; interaction .
In this way the <unk> acts as a &lt; unk &gt; auxiliary .
( The starting material is not &lt; unk &gt; but the <unk> of <unk> <unk> suggests that the auxiliary <unk> the &lt; unk &gt; . )
&lt; unk &gt; &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; substrates can exhibit <unk> to &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; <unk> if &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; are used .
The example below generates a &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; in 64 % <unk> and 95 % <unk> <unk> .
&lt; unk &gt; has <unk> developed a <unk> @ - @ based auxiliary for &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; that was employed in the first <unk> synthesis of &lt; unk &gt; .
The key step <unk> an unusual <unk> of &lt; unk &gt; @ - @ 2 @ - @ &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; as <unk> .
The first &lt; unk &gt; Lewis acid promoted <unk> &lt; unk &gt; &lt; unk &gt; was reported by &lt; unk &gt; <unk> and utilized <unk> ( II ) &lt; unk &gt; <unk> <unk> with up to 98 % <unk> .

It &apos; s &lt; unk &gt; , <unk> , and full of &lt; unk &gt; and &lt; unk &gt; .
